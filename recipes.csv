0,World's Best Honey Garlic Pork Chops,4.4,(645),475,10 mins,15 mins,25 mins,6,6 servings,"When you're in need of a quick and easy dinner that the whole family will love, look no further than pork chops. This 5-star grilled pork chop recipe has reviewers' mouths watering thanks to the spectacular honey-garlic glaze — but the 25-minute fridge-to-table time is also a perk too. There might not be an actual award given to pork chops, but if there was, this 5-ingredient dish would surely win it thanks to the sauce alone. Reviewers rave about the ketchup, honey, soy sauce, and garlic glaze that is brushed onto the chops on the grill. In fact, many reviewers suggest marinating the pork chops in the glaze first, brushing them with more glaze on the grill, and making an extra batch of sauce to serve on the side for dipping because it's just that good. When the weather is nice, take your pork chops outside and throw them on the grill. Not only will they cook up quickly, but they'll also get the tasty grill marks that everyone loves. Grilling pork chops is incredibly simple, all you have to do is preheat your grill to medium heat and oil the grate. Then lightly brush the glaze over the chops and sear them on both sides until they are no longer pink in the middle. You'll want to grill your pork chops until they are no longer pink in the middle and reach an internal temperature of at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). The National Pork Board recommends about eight to 12 minutes for pork chops that are ¾-inch thick. However, every grill is different so it may take some grills longer while some may cook faster. In this recipe, you can use either boneless or bone-in pork chops. They typically take about the same amount of time to cook, so it's really up to personal preference or what's on sale at the grocery store this week. You will want to pay attention to the thickness of the pork chop, though. Thicker pork chops will take longer to cook, but they won't dry out as easily as thinner pork chops can on the grill. So, thicker pork chops are usually recommended for grilling. Yes! If you don't have a grill or the weather isn't looking that great, you can bake these pork chops instead. Reviewers tend to bake them at 350 degrees F for about 40-45 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F. Pork chops are so versatile that you can serve them with just about anything. But, if you need some inspiration, try one of these top-rated side dishes.

3,Chicken Cordon Bleu,4.6,"(2,668)","1,849",10 mins,35 mins,45 mins,4,4 servings,"Don't feel like going out tonight? You can easily make a gourmet restaurant-worthy meal in the comfort of your own kitchen with this top-rated chicken cordon bleu recipe. It's impressive, delicious, and way simpler than you think. A cordon bleu is a dish that traditionally consists of meat wrapped around cheese, then breaded and pan-fried or deep-fried. Many modern versions of the classic French recipe, such as this one, are baked. Classic chicken cordon bleu is made with the following ingredients: chicken cutlets, cooked ham, Swiss cheese, bread crumbs, and simple spices. It's usually topped with a rich cream sauce spiked with a hint of Dijon mustard. ""Cordon bleu"" translates to ""blue ribbon."" According to Larousse Gastronomique, a French food encyclopedia, the phrase dates back to medieval times when the most prestigious order a knight could earn was called the Cross of the Holy Spirit. The honor was signified by a medal that hung from a blue ribbon known as Le Cordon Bleu. Over time, the blue ribbon became a symbol of excellence. The term, meanwhile, became associated with food that meets the highest of standards or that is prepared by the most prestigious chefs. There are many ways to make chicken cordon bleu, from the traditional French method to the simple oven-baked one detailed here. You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect: Cover the chicken cutlets with plastic wrap and pound them with a mallet to create thin, even pieces. Thoroughly season the chicken with salt and pepper. Top each piece of chicken with one slice of Swiss cheese and one slice of ham. Roll the chicken vertically so that the ham and cheese are contained. Secure each roll with a toothpick. Arrange the chicken rolls in a prepared baking dish. Sprinkle liberally and evenly with breadcrumbs. Bake until the chicken is no longer pink, top each roll with half a slice of Swiss, and continue baking until the cheese is melted. This recipe should be fully cooked after 30-35 minutes in an oven preheated to 350 degrees F. However, every oven is different — the chicken should no longer be pink and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Chicken cordon bleu is traditionally topped with a decadent cream sauce made with Parmesan cheese and Dijon mustard — you can improvise your own recipe or try spiking our top-rated Alfredo Sauce with a hint of Dijon.

Reheat in the oven instead of the microwave to avoid sogginess. About 10 minutes at 350 degrees F should do the trick. To freeze chicken cordon bleu, simply arrange the completely-cooled rolls on a lined baking sheet, cover, and freeze for about two hours. Transfer the now-frozen rolls to an airtight freezer bag labeled with the date. Freeze for up to four months. To thaw frozen chicken cordon bleu, transfer the container to the fridge the night before you plan to serve it. Bake the thawed rolls for about 10 minutes at 350 degrees F. ""What a wonderful recipe,"" raves Pj kearns. ""Simple and delicious! I did use a little olive oil to roll the chicken in after it was constructed and then lightly breaded them.

All you need is five simple ingredients and your oven for these tender, flavorful ribs that your whole family will love. After one bite, you'll never want to use another BBQ rib recipe ever again.

We like the method this recipe uses, which is to put the barbecue sauce on the ribs after they're boiled — but before they go in the oven. This will allow the ribs to get all the barbecue flavor while the sauce bakes into the ribs. If you want, you can serve these BBQ ribs with an extra side of barbecue sauce for dipping.

61,Garlic-Brown Sugar Chicken Thighs,4.6,(226),201,10 mins,35 mins,45 mins,8,8 chicken thighs,"This brown sugar chicken recipe gets top marks for its crisp, golden skin and delicious garlicky-sweet sauce. Home cook Jason's mouthwatering dish uses pantry-friendly ingredients like dried herbs and honey to create a sumptuous chicken dinner that will please all palates. Try garlic brown sugar chicken thighs for a rich, hearty meal that couldn't be easier to make. Ready for a bite that's tender, sweet, savory, and crunchy all at once? You'll find the full recipe below with step-by-step instructions, but here's what you can expect when you make this top-rated recipe; Start by searing seasoned chicken thighs in an oven-proof skillet until the skin is brown. Set chicken aside before cooking minced garlic, brown sugar, honey, and herbs in the pan drippings. Return chicken thighs to the skillet and oven roast until crispy skin forms and juices run clear. Both boneless and bone-in chicken thighs are affordable, delicious options for oven-baked recipes, but bone-in wins for best taste. The marrow in the bones spreads to the meat during cooking, creating an unforgettably rich flavor. Boneless thighs are best for nights when time is of the essence — you'll still get the sweet, zesty flavor you want with a slightly shorter cook time. This bold oven-roasted chicken recipe works with just about anything. Try pairing garlic brown sugar chicken with a roasted vegetable side dish or earthy risotto to cut through the sweetness. A garlicky toast or tangy potato salad would also complement this dish well. Refrigerate leftover chicken in an airtight container to safely reheat and enjoy for up to four days. Leftover garlic brown sugar chicken can be safely frozen for up to three months — simply allow the chicken to come to room temperature before sealing it in a plastic freezer bag and squeezing out any air. Reheat in the oven or on the stovetop for best results.

121,Spicy Thai Basil Chicken (Pad Krapow Gai),4.8,"(1,118)",774,15 mins,10 mins,25 mins,2,2 servings,"Allrecipes home cooks give a solid 5-star rating to Chef John's easy-to-make version of Thai basil chicken (pad krapow gai), a popular Thai restaurant-worthy dish that's ready in less than 30 minutes. In his easy and accessible style, Chef John walks you through the recipe ingredients and shows you how to build layers of flavor using simple cooking techniques. ""I don't cook Thai food at home often, mostly because there are at least a dozen such restaurants within walking distance, but when I do, there's nothing I enjoy more than this spicy Thai basil chicken,"" says Chef John. Thai basil chicken is a stir-fry dish made with finely chopped or ground chicken cooked with chile peppers, garlic, and shallots, and seasoned with a sweet and salty sauce and finished with fresh basil. It's a classic dish in Thai cuisine and can be found in restaurants and as a popular street food. SauceChicken broth, oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, white sugar, and brown sugar are whisked together to make a sweet and salty mixture to flavor the recipe. ChickenChef John minces skinless, boneless chicken thigh until they're very finely chopped. You could use packaged ground chicken to speed up the process, but chopping or grinding your own gives you superior flavor and texture. Shallots and garlicSliced shallots and minced garlic add another layer of flavor. Hot chile peppersThis is where the heat comes into play. Use Thai chile, serrano chile, or other hot pepper of your choice, and customize the amount to suit your tolerance for heat. BasilThis recipe traditionally uses Thai basil or ""holy"" basil, which have their own distinctive flavors. Chef John uses sweet basil, which is more readily available in most grocery stores. In the recipe video, Chef John demonstrates how he stacks and rolls basil leaves like a cigar to quickly slice thin ribbons that cook faster and impart flavor throughout the dish. ""No, I didn't use the real ""holy"" basil,"" says Chef John. ""But even with regular basil, this simple recipe is spectacular. Aromatic basil is the perfect herb for pairing with the slightly sweet, sort of salty, and possibly spicy, chopped meat."" There are more than 100 varieties of basil, all of which are members of the mint family, and each variety has its own flavor. Thai basil has a mildly spicy licorice or anise seed flavor. Sweet basil (also known as Italian basil) tastes sweet and peppery. Holy basil (also called Thai holy basil) tastes of pepper and cloves.

Chef John recommends you prep all the ingredients before you start cooking because once you start the stir-fry, it all comes together very quickly. Prep takes about 15 minutes and cooking time is a speedy 10 minutes. If you want to serve the chicken with steamed rice, time your cooking accordingly. To get started, you'll add the oil and minced chicken to a smoking-hot skillet and cook the chicken briefly for a couple of minutes. Next, you'll add the shallots, garlic, and sliced chilies, and cook for another couple of minutes. About a tablespoon of the sauce goes in next to cook for a minute with the chicken until it starts to caramelize on the skillet. Finally, you add the rest of the sauce, scraping up the caramelization and coating the chicken for another minute. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the basil until it's wilted from the residual heat. Now your Thai Basil Chicken is ready to serve. ""Amazing taste and for sure cheaper than buying it in a Thai restaurant,"" says Allrecipes home cook Seora Juarez. ""As suggested, go to a local Asian market to get your basil. It's a more authentic taste, but I've tried it with regular basil and it tastes good too. I like mine hot so I finely chop the peppers to make it spicy."" ""Amazing rendition of the classic Thai dish. I tend to use extra garlic and shallots. I use serrano chilies because traditional Thai chilies involve an extra grocery store. Otherwise make as directed. Perfect for family meals when I have the time to cook, and my kids love it,"" says reviewer Blair Dunn. Allrecipes community member outdoorsgirl says, ""I love Thai food and do a lot of cooking. Kudos to Chef John for taking a Thai recipe and simplifying it so the average person can make a great dish!

123,Simple Beef Stroganoff,4.1,(942),733,5 mins,15 mins,20 mins,4,,"Homemade stroganoff doesn't have to be hard! This simple ground beef stroganoff comes together in 20 minutes with just six ingredients. Beef stroganoff is an iconic Russian dish that consists of beef in a creamy sauce. According to legend, it was created by chefs who worked for the Stroganov family in the 1800s. The dish is often made with mushrooms and served over rice or egg noodles. Traditional beef stroganoff is made with steak, a roux-based sauce, and sauteed mushrooms. But, as the title suggests, this recipe is simplified. It relies on shortcut ingredients, such as ground beef and canned cream of mushroom soup, to keep the cook time down and to cut down on extra steps. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what can you can expect when you make this ground beef stroganoff: Saute ground beef until brown, then drain the fat. Add the canned soup and garlic powder. Simmer for about 10 minutes, then remove from heat. Stir cooked egg noodles and sour cream into the meat mixture. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Since this ground beef stroganoff is a rather heavy dish, you may not need a side dish at all. A simple side salad, though, is a great way to round out your meal and to add a pop of color. Of course, if you want something a little different, you could leave out the egg noodles and serve the ground beef and sauce mixture over white rice or mashed potatoes. Store leftover beef stroganoff in an airtight container in the fridge for up to four days. Reheat in the microwave or on the stove. Unfortunately, cooked egg noodles don't freeze well. If you'd like to freeze this ground beef stroganoff recipe, it's best to prepare it without the noodles. Freeze the beef-sauce mixture in a freezer-safe container for up to three months. Thaw on the stove and stir in cooked egg noodles before serving. ""My family loved this,"" says Amy Stewart. ""I took a previous reviewer's suggestion and added a packet of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix, I think this is what made it so delicious! I also threw in a small can of mushrooms.

Well, your search ends with this recipe for the best baked haddock you've ever tasted. It's quick, easy, and has all the crispy goodness of fried fish without the mess of deep frying. We promise everyone at your table will love this delectable entree. You'll find the full, step-by-step baked haddock recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you should expect: In one bowl, combine milk and salt. In a separate bowl combine the Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, and thyme. Dip the haddock filet into the wet mixture, then into the dry mixture. Place on a baking dish and repeat with each remaining filet. Drizzle the fish with melted butter. Bake the haddock until the fish is flaky and the crust is golden brown. If you follow this recipe, you'll bake your fish at 500 degrees F for 15 minutes. This amount of time will result in perfectly flaky haddock with a nice crispy crust. You'll know the haddock is done when the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F. Baked haddock is a light main dish, so we love pairing it with a couple of sides.

150,Crab Legs with Garlic Butter Sauce,4.7,(212),158,5 mins,15 mins,20 mins,2,,"Make any dinner a special occasion with homemade crab legs. Cooked in a flavorful garlic butter sauce, these Snow Crab legs are never a bad idea. This recipe calls for Snow Crab legs, which are known for their mild flavor and easy-to-crack shell. Less expensive than King Crab legs, you should be able to find fresh or frozen Snow Crab clusters at your local grocery store or seafood monger. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you cook these flavorful crab legs in garlic butter sauce: Melt butter in a skillet, then add the garlic and cook until it's translucent. Add the seasonings and cook until the butter is bubbling. Cut a lengthwise slit into each shell. Add the legs to the butter mixture and simmer until the crabmeat is heated through. The crab legs should be fully cooked after about five or six minutes in the bubbling butter mixture. The whole recipe, sauce and all, only takes about 20 minutes to make. It's actually quite simple to eat Snow Crab legs — and you don't even need a special cracking tool. Just pull one of the legs off the cluster, bend at the joint, and pull the joints apart slowly. The meat should slide right out. Helpful hint: Make sure the legs are warm when you crack them, as it's more difficult to get cold crabmeat out of the shell. Store the cooked crab legs in an airtight container in the refrigerator for three to five days. When you're ready to enjoy them again, brush the crab legs with butter (bonus points if you have leftover garlic butter) and bake in a 350 degrees F oven for about eight minutes. ""You may be tempted to increase the sauce since it won't cover the crab completely, but as long as you crack the legs prior to putting them in the sauce, you shouldn't have a problem,"" according to mfreeman89. ""The sauce will lend a wonderful flavor without overpowering the crab."" ""This is my favorite way to prepare crab legs,"" raves Renee. ""The buttery garlic flavor accents the flavor of the crab very well. It was also easy to make. Using pre-cooked crab legs was pretty convenient. Great recipe!"" ""This was so easy and so good,"" says alylikestoeat. ""My family LOVED it. Use all the excess butter after for the dipping sauce, if you even need it. It's already so good on its own.""

151,Baked Chicken Schnitzel,4.5,(263),222,20 mins,10 mins,30 mins,6,,"Think you can't make chicken schnitzel without frying? Think again! This baked recipe imitates that deep-fried feel without using a ton of oil. All you need is to employ a couple simple hacks — heat the pan beforehand and drizzle the chicken with olive oil twice. Schnitzel, which originated in Eastern Europe, is a thin slice of meat that is breaded and fried. You can make it with chicken, pork, veal (wiener-schnitzel), and other types of meat. The word ""schnitzel"" comes from the German word ""schnitt,"" which means ""cut."" Here's what you'll need to make crispy chicken schnitzel in the oven: OilUnlike traditional schnitzel, this recipe isn't deep-fried in oil. However, you'll still need to grease the pan with a little olive oil — it'll add flavor and keep the chicken from sticking. ChickenChicken breasts are cut in half lengthwise and flattened with a meat mallet until they're about ¼-inch thick. FlourAll-purpose flour works with the eggs and seasoned bread crumbs to make a crunchy, crispy breading. PaprikaPaprika lends a smoky flavor to this chicken schnitzel recipe. EggsTwo whole eggs hold the breading together and helps it stick to the chicken. Seasoned Bread CrumbsYou can use store-bought bread crumbs or make your own seasoned bread crumbs at home. Lemon ZestThe zest of one lemon adds brightness and citrusy flavor to the crunchy breading. You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this chicken schnitzel: Line a baking sheet with foil drizzled with olive oil. Place the pan in the preheated oven to ensure the pan is hot before the meat even touches it — this will ensure that the breading gets extra crispy during cooking. Pound the chicken breast halves with a meat mallet until they're about ¼-inch thick. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Make the breading with flour, paprika, eggs, bread crumbs, and lemon zest. Dredge the chicken in the bread crumb mixture. Remove the baking sheet from the oven. Arrange the chicken in a single layer on the pan, then drizzle with more oil. Bake the chicken for five or six minutes. Flip and continue to cook until the chicken is no longer pink. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F. Chicken schnitzel pairs well with just about anything, from French fries to steamed broccoli.

""Only changes were a dash of garlic powder in the flour mixture, and some minced garlic in the egg mixture."" ""I know that when I make chicken like this, I will hear no complaints from the husband or the kids,"" according to Allrecipes Allstar Kim's Cooking Now. ""I only had unseasoned bread crumbs on hand, so I just threw in some seasoning of my own (garlic powder, onion powder, dried oregano and dried basil).

180,Butternut Squash Soup,4.6,"(2,536)","1,968",20 mins,45 mins,1 hrs 5 mins,4,4 servings,"This top-rated butternut squash soup is basically fall in a bowl — smooth and creamy, it's sure to warm you up from the inside on a brisk autumn day. This recipe uses a handful of simple, affordable ingredients to create a standout soup that's more than the sum of its parts. Here, the vegetables are sautéed in butter, although reviewers had success substituting with olive oil, too. These vegetables give body and depth of flavor to the soup, without overwhelming the squash. Once the vegetables are tender, you may use an immersion blender or blend them in batches using a standing blender to achieve a smooth, creamy texture. Use either one medium butternut squash (~2 pounds) or about 3 cups of pre-cut butternut squash. Chicken or vegetable stock makes up the base of this soup, and can be used to thin out the natural creaminess of the pureed vegetables. If you prefer a thicker soup, use less stock. This recipe keeps things simple with just salt and pepper for seasoning. However, reviewers say it can be easily customized with spices of your choosing, including cayenne pepper, nutmeg, curry powder, sage, etc. Arguably the most difficult part of this recipe is preparing the butternut squash. After all, winter squash gets its long shelf life from its tough outer skin. But don't be intimidated, you can follow this easy method for peeling butternut squash: 1. Cut the squash in half crosswise, separating the ""bulb"" from the ""tube."" Slice the stem and the bottom of the bulb off and stand both pieces on a flat surface. 2. Use a vegetable peeler to peel away the skin from top to bottom. Once both are peeled, cut each piece in half, scoop out the seeds, and chop. Tip: Some reviewers suggest using the microwave to soften the skin prior to peeling. To do so, simply use a fork to poke holes in the squash and pop the whole squash microwave for 2-3 minutes. Then follow the above steps for peeling. Butternut squash soup's mild flavor makes it an excellent choice for bold, flavorful toppings. Some favorites among Allrecipes reviewers include sour cream, red pepper, green onions, crumbled bacon, croutons, fresh herbs, and shredded cheese. This soup makes a great fall or winter appetizer, but can also be served as a main dish with a side of corn muffins, crusty bread, roasted vegetables, or a side salad. Keep leftover butternut squash soup stored in the fridge for up to four days, or freeze for up to three months in an airtight container. When you're ready to serve, thaw the soup in the fridge overnight (if frozen) and reheat in the microwave or on the stovetop until warmed through. ""I recommend blending only half of it and leaving the other half chunky to give it some texture,"" says one Allrecipes Member. ""It has actually become a Thanksgiving appetizer for us due to an overwhelming amount of people in my very large extended family who just love it,"" says reviewer valerie160.

183,Homemade Dumplings,4.7,"(1,589)","1,297",5 mins,15 mins,20 mins,6,6 dumplings,"Have a hankering for light, fluffy, tender dumplings just like your mom used to make? You've come to the right place. These homemade dumplings are easy to make with just six pantry staples – and they're even easier to eat. With this top-rated recipe, you'll make perfect dumplings every time. A dumpling is a small mass of dough that can be boiled, fried, baked, or steamed. There are a ton of dumpling varieties out there, from pork- and cabbage-filled Chinese dumplings to cheesy Polish dumplings. These boiled drop dumplings, which are popular in the U.S., are often paired with chicken and broth to create a popular comfort food called chicken and dumplings. They're prepared by dropping spoonfuls of dough into a pot of boiling soup or stew. The starch in the dumplings thickens the broth, resulting in a rich stew that's impossible to resist. This recipe is made with just six ingredients you probably already have on hand. FlourThese dumplings start with all-purpose flour, which creates structure and holds the other ingredients together. Baking PowderBaking powder is a leavening agent, which means it releases gas that makes the dough expand. It's responsible for the dumplings' light and fluffy texture. White SugarA teaspoon of sugar adds an extremely subtle hint of sweetness. It also helps the dumplings retain their moisture through the cooking process and slows gluten development, which ensures tender dumplings. SaltA pinch of salt seasons the dumplings and enhances the flavors of the other ingredients. Butter or MargarineCold butter or margarine is cut into the flour mixture to bind the dry ingredients together. It also keeps the dumplings light and tender. MilkWhole milk helps create a smooth, moist dough. To make sure a dumpling is done cooking, pierce it with a fork or toothpick. You'll know it's done when the fork or toothpick comes out clean. You can store leftover cooked dumplings or dumpling soup in an airtight container in the fridge for two to three days. Reheat gently on the stove or in 10-second intervals in the microwave. Some people like to freeze dumpling dough for quick and easy cooking. It couldn't be easier: Just drop spoonfuls of dough onto a baking sheet, flash freeze for at least three hours or up to overnight, then transfer the now-frozen dough to a freezer-safe container or zip-top bag. Label with the date and freeze for about three months. When it's time to use them, let the dumplings thaw for about 30 minutes and then drop them directly into the soup or stew. ""I have made the same old dumplings for years,"" says LIZ1888. ""I came upon this recipe and tried it. These were great! I made them for chicken and dumplings. They also thickened the sauce as they cooked."" ""The dumplings came out so light and fluffy and flavorful,"" according to ALISON K. ""I was searching for a dumpling recipe made from scratch instead of a mix and was so happy to find this one."" ""I topped a vegetable stew with these dumplings on a chilly autumn evening in Wisconsin,"" says Pam Westfall ""Oh yum! Truly delicious. The perfect comfort food!""

184,Good New Orleans Creole Gumbo,4.9,"(1,183)",949,1 hrs,2 hrs 40 mins,3 hrs 40 mins,20,20 servings,"New Orleans-style gumbo is a true taste of Southern tradition. This boldly flavored stew is bursting with fresh, filling ingredients like bell pepper, sausage, stewed tomatoes, and crabmeat. Hot sauce ad Cajun seasonings add a kick that makes this Lousiana dish a favorite amongst our community of home cooks. Learn how to make the best homestyle gumbo right here. Gumbo is one of the most famous dishes to result from Louisiana's shared Creole-Cajun heritage. Gumbo falls somewhere between a thick stew and a hearty soup and can contain ingredients such as chicken, sausage, ham, seafood, okra, tomatoes, and greens. As varied as the recipes can be, there are a few ingredients that all gumbos have in common: homemade stock; the ""holy trinity"" of celery, onions, and green peppers; and roux. Boldly delicious New Orleans-style gumbo is surprisingly easy to make at home. You'll find the full recipe below with step-by-step instructions, but here's what you can expect when you make this top-rated recipe: Great gumbo starts with roux, a flavorful thickening agent made from equal parts fat and flour. Once the roux is a deep golden color, add diced veggies and sausage to the mix. Then, incorporate beef bouillon, hot sauce, tomatoes, and seasonings to intensify the flavor. Let the gumbo simmer for 45 minutes before adding file powder, okra, and seafood. The result will be a lusciously hearty stew packed with Creole spice. Gumbo file, or file powder, is made from dried sassafras leaves. This ingredient was first used by Choctaw Indians and was later adopted by Acadians (Cajuns) when they arrived in the American South. Gumbo file has a deep, earthy flavor similar to thyme and should be added to gumbo in the last minutes of cooking — it helps to thicken and enrich the stew for an authentic taste of New Orleans. Leftover gumbo can be stored safely in the refrigerator for three to four days. Let the dish come to room temperature before placing it in an airtight container to enjoy later. Gently reheat on the stovetop for best results. ""This is one of the best gumbos I've ever had and my family is from the South so that is saying a lot — just don't tell my mother or grandmother,"" shares reviewer mellie18_99. ""I added shrimp, sausage, chicken, and crab meat."" ""This recipe is the real deal,"" raves home cook Pat. ""Don't forget the file gumbo at the very end, it makes a big difference. You will know when the roux is done when it has the color of a Hershey's milk chocolate bar.""

185,Absolutely Ultimate Potato Soup,4.7,"(2,953)","2,272",15 mins,30 mins,45 mins,8,8 servings,"A bowl of this ultra-comforting potato soup will please everyone at your table. This potato soup comes together quickly with basic ingredients. You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect: Cook bacon in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until brown and crispy. Drain bacon on paper towels and drain most (but not all!) of the bacon grease. Cook the celery, onion, and garlic in the remaining bacon grease. Add cubed potatoes and toss with veggies. Return the bacon to the pan and cover all the ingredients with chicken stock. Cover and simmer until the potatoes are tender. In a separate skillet, whisk butter into melted flour until slightly thickened. Whisk in heavy cream, tarragon, and cilantro. Bring the mixture to a boil and cook until thick and creamy. Stir cream mixture into potato mixture. Transfer half of the soup to a blender and puree, then return to the Dutch oven. Season to taste and serve with your favorite toppings, such as crumbled bacon or shredded Cheddar cheese. Russet potatoes work well for this soup because they are starchy and fall apart easily during cooking, resulting in a smooth texture. Stay away from waxy potatoes as they won't break down as well. We love this top-rated recipe because it results in a thick, satisfying soup. If you somehow end up with a thinner consistency than you'd like, though, there are a few ways to thicken it. For an easy fix, just add more boiled potatoes and incorporate them into the soup or stir in instant potato flakes. You can also make a slurry with one part water and one part cornstarch. Stir the slurry slowly into the soup until you've reached the desired thickness. Let the potato soup cool completely, then transfer to an airtight storage container. Store in the fridge for up to four days. Reheat in the microwave or on the stove. Unfortunately, potato soup doesn't freeze well. Not only do potatoes become grainy as they thaw, but dairy-based soups tend to separate during the thawing and reheating processes. Avoid freezing potato soup if you can. If you must freeze potato soup, ladle it into zip-top freezer bags in serving-sized portions. Squeeze out the excess air, seal, label with the date, lay flat in the freezer, and freeze for up to six months. Favorite potato soup toppings include shredded Cheddar cheese, crumbled bacon, green onions, and chives. It's your potato soup – garnish it with as many or as few toppings as you please.

208,Best Damn Chili,4.7,(681),534,30 mins,2 hrs 15 mins,2 hrs 45 mins,12,12 servings,"Are you on the hunt to find the best chili recipe on the internet? Well, stop right there, because you just did! If you're looking for hearty, filling chili that's just the right level of spicy, this is the chili recipe for you. Yes, this recipe does look like you throw everything but the kitchen sink in it, but wow is the long ingredient list worth it. You might as well just make a double batch because you'll be craving more as soon as it's gone. You'll find the full, detailed recipe below, but here's what you can expect when making this chili: In a large pot, sauté the onion, bell pepper, Anaheim pepper, jalapeños, and garlic until softened. Brown the ground beef, then season it with Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, bouillon, and beer. Once combined, add the beef mixture to the vegetable mixture. Stir crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, wine, and seasonings into the beef and vegetable mixture. Bring the mixture to a boil, then simmer until the flavors have blended together, about 90 minutes. Add in kidney beans, then simmer for another 30 minutes, until the beans are hot. In a blender, combine sour cream, cilantro, and cumin to create a crema. Serve the chili topped with crema and any other toppings you like. This chili should already be your preferred level of thickness, thanks to all the thickening agents in it. But if you're having trouble reaching your desired consistency, there are multiple ways to thicken chili. The easiest way is to simply simmer it for longer. The longer it simmers, the more liquid will evaporate. But, if you don't have time to simmer your chili for hours, you can thicken it with cornmeal, cornstarch, or all-purpose flour. Add 1 tablespoon of cornmeal directly to the pot and allow it to simmer for about 10 more minutes to thicken up. Or add a cornstarch or flour slurry — this means 1 tablespoon of water mixed with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch or 2 tablespoons of water mixed with 1 tablespoon of flour. If you add flour or cornstarch directly to the chili, it will clump. Instead, gradually whisk in the slurry then simmer for 10 minutes. Another option is to add more starchy ingredients, like vegetables or beans. These will absorb some of the liquids and thicken the chili. Plus, you'll have more hearty and delicious ingredients to enjoy. Chili is filling enough to stand-alone as a full meal itself, but you can always add sides or even use chili as a ""topping"" for other foods. Try serving it with cornbread, coleslaw, or grilled corn. For more inspiration check out our best side dishes to serve with chili. We love to use chili as a topping over rice, baked potatoes, nachos, and even as a filling for tacos. Let your heart (and stomach) decide how you want to enjoy your chili because the possibilities are endless. Package completely-cooled chili into an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator for up to four days. If you want your chili to last longer, you should freeze it. Ladle completely cooled individual servings of chili into zip-top freezer bags (make sure to squeeze out the excess air). Label and date the bags, and store them in the freezer for up to three months. When you're ready to eat it, thaw it overnight in the fridge and reheat on the stove or in the microwave. ""This really is the best chili recipe and ""the"" go-to for anytime we crave this comfort dish. The recipe is excellent as is.

Garlic, cream, and fresh thyme join meaty caramelized mushrooms and diced onions for a rich, fragrant bowlful of homemade goodness.

Luscious, herb-infused mushroom soup is just a few steps away. You'll find the full recipe below with step-by-step instructions, but here's what you can expect when you make this top-rated recipe: Begin by melting butter in a large saucepan and caramelizing the mushrooms — it's important to cook them until a deep golden color is achieved for maximum flavor.

230,Italian Wedding Soup,4.6,(983),765,20 mins,30 mins,50 mins,4,,"Warm up with a hearty bowl of Italian wedding soup. This top-rated soup recipe is the perfect bowl of comfort that everyone will love. Want to know the best part? This Italian wedding soup only requires a few ingredients and comes together in less than an hour. Italian wedding soup is a hearty Italian soup consisting of noodles, vegetables, meatballs, and broth. It was originally a ""peasant dish,"" meaning it's made from inexpensive ingredients that anyone could find. Even though it's called ""wedding soup,"" this soup has nothing to do with weddings. The name comes from the Italian phrase ""minestra maritata,"" which actually means married soup. But it's not the marriage we think of — it's actually referring to the marriage of the ingredients and the flavor it produces. Most Italian wedding soups contain these ingredients: MeatballsCombine ground beef, egg, bread crumbs, Parmesan, basil, and onion powder to create the meatballs. BrothThis recipe calls for chicken broth — though reviewers have had luck using different broths too. VegetablesThis soup has escarole and carrots. You can also add onions or celery if you want more color. PastaThis recipe calls for orzo. This particular recipe calls for orzo pasta, which is what we like to use. But you can really use any small pasta you have on hand, like ditalini or acini de pepe. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's what you can expect when making this Italian wedding soup: Combine ground beef, egg, bread crumbs, Parmesan, basil, and onion powder and shape into small meatballs. In a pot, boil broth and add escarole, orzo pasta, chopped carrot and meatballs. Cook at a slow boil until the pasta is al dente. Italian wedding soup really does have it all, so don't feel pressured to serve it with anything! However, we like serving this soup with a warm dinner roll. Store completely cooled Italian wedding soup in an airtight container in the fridge for up to four days. You may need to add more broth or water when you're ready to reheat the soup, as the pasta tends to soak it up. Reheat on the stove or in the microwave until warmed through. Italian wedding soup freezes well. Ladle the completely cooled soup into individually portioned zip-top freezer bags. Freeze flat for up to three months. Thaw in the fridge overnight and reheat on the stove until warmed through. ""I love this soup. The only changes I made was to use mild Italian sausage for the meatballs, which I made in advance, and I used baby spinach leaves instead of escarole,"" says slowcooker. ""I added the spinach during the last minute of cooking. This is a great weeknight soup."" ""I made this for the first time on Easter. My husband and I had had it before but my guests were delighted. It was better than any I had tasted. It has become a family favorite, and I like that it is so simple to make,"" raves one Allrecipes community member. ""This soup is the best!

251,Crispy Hash Browns,4.5,"(1,176)",885,20 mins,15 mins,35 mins,4,4 servings,"If you're a firm believer that potatoes make basically any meal taste better, then you've come to the right place. Because we are too — especially when it comes to breakfast potatoes. Choosing which type of breakfast potato to make can be a tough decision, but if you're craving crispy potatoes that remind you of your favorite restaurant, then you should try this hash brown recipe. The shredded potatoes are formed into pancake-like hash browns and lightly pan-fried for the perfect crispy texture that will pair deliciously with any breakfast dish. Believe it or not, making crispy hash browns is actually quite easy. First, shred your potatoes using your preferred method — either with a grater, food processor, or mandoline. Rinse the potatoes until the water is clear, then drain and squeeze out all the remaining liquid (this will ensure the hash browns are extra crispy). Next, you'll add in your binding agents (flour and egg) as well as any other ingredients or seasonings. This recipe only calls for onion, but you could also add cheese, cayenne pepper, or garlic to the mixture. Form your hash browns into patties (either one large hash brown or multiple smaller pancake-like hash browns) and pan fry them in oil, about five minutes on each side. To keep your hash browns crispy, make sure to heat the oil to sizzling before adding the patties and wait until the one side is golden brown before flipping. You can also make your hash browns thinner because they will get crispier and cook more evenly. If you care about the crisp, then you should use starchy potatoes, like russets or Idahoes. The only drawback is that the hash browns may be prone to falling apart because of the starchiness. So, if you want your hash brown to stick together easily, then you should use a waxy potato, like new potatoes, Yukon Golds, or red potatoes. These potatoes have more moisture and will stick together in the pan, however, they won't crisp up as nicely as starchy potatoes. The biggest culprit that's making your hash browns come apart is moisture. You need to make sure the potatoes are dry before adding them to the flour and egg mixture. Whether you squeeze them out in a dish towel or use a salad spinner, get the potatoes as dry as they can be. You can also use a different type of potato if you are worried about the hash browns breaking apart. If you use a waxy potato, they'll stick together nicely, but they won't get as crispy as you might want. Another option is to add more ingredients that will act as binders. Try adding cheese to your hash browns because when the cheese melts it will be like a gooey glue that holds your potatoes together. ""These turned out great! They weren't greasy at all, they held together perfectly, and they looked quite pretty when they were done cooking, too. Next time, I think I will add salt & pepper, plus some extra spices, to the shredded potato and egg/flour mixture, just to give it a more intense flavor. This recipe is so easy that I will have no problems just making these hash browns from memory, eyeballing the flour and spices,"" says eiskyjente. ""Unbelievable. About as good as one could hope for. Crispy on the outside, firm and tasty on the inside. And what a flavor. This will be my hash brown recipe from here on out. Make sure that you don't have too much oil in the pan. The hash browns will take forever to brown and may be too greasy for your taste,"" advises Curt McLey. ""My first try at making hash browns. Success. I added sharp Cheddar, a little garlic powder, a dash of oregano, and some green onions. I will keep this recipe and use it over and over. Always trying a little something different,"" raves MR BANANA.

252,Best Meatloaf,4.5,"(1,028)",828,15 mins,1 hrs 10 mins,1 hrs 25 mins,12,1 meatloaf,"Good old-fashioned meatloaf stands alongside hot dogs and apple pie as iconic American foods. That's not to say any of those dishes actually originated in America, but that hasn't stopped us from embedding them deeply into our culture and lore, and making them our own. Meatloaf especially is a product of ingenuity and making-do as thrifty, waste-not home cooks combine low-cost ingredients to make a satisfying main dish that will stretch ingredients and feed a family. Yet, as a highly customizable recipe, meatloaf can be found everywhere from classic diners to high-end restaurants, to everyday dinner tables. Meatloaf recipes are typically made of ground meats mixed with vegetables, seasonings, and crushed crackers or fine breadcrumbs, and are held together with a binder; usually an egg or two. This top-rated recipe for Best Meatloaf demonstrates how to make a meatloaf using the most simple ingredients and tried-and-tested techniques: Meat mixtureThis recipe for Best Meatloaf uses extra-lean ground beef, which means the fat-to-meat ratio is about 4 percent fat to 96 percent lean. The low ratio of fat results in a meatloaf with minimal grease. But since fat carries flavor, you'll want to add some back to keep blandness at bay. By adding a touch of sour cream to the mixture, this recipe benefits from that little extra fat plus a hint of tangy flavor at the same time. Note: adding milk is optional and may only be necessary if you're cooking at higher altitudes. Sautéed vegetablesCooking minced aromatics (a fancy term for the onion and garlic) in butter before adding it to the meat mixture mellows the flavors and ensures you won't bite into the sharp taste of onion and garlic. Flavor boostersThere's nothing shy about the taste of Worcestershire sauce, and adding it to the mix along with tomato sauce brings sweet and savory flavor to every bite. A top glaze of tomato sauce and ketchup creates a delectable sauce to finish the dish. Baking techniqueHow long to cook meatloaf depends on the size of the loaf and the temperature of the oven. Ideally, you want to fully cook the inside to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). This recipe for Best Meatloaf gives you a clever 3-step approach: You'll bake the meatloaf for 40 minutes at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) to fully cook the inside, and then increase the heat to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 15 minutes to give the outside a tasty crust. Finally, you'll brush the meatloaf with tomato sauce and ketchup, and bake it for 10 more minutes to caramelize the glaze. Don't overwork the mixCombine the ingredients until they just come together, otherwise you'll end up with a dense, compacted meatloaf. Think smallI'm talking about the size of the solid add-ins. Cut the onions and garlic (or any other vegetables you might add) into very small, uniform pieces before sautéeing them. Crush the crackers and crumble the breadcrumbs until they're very fine. This helps make a more uniform meatloaf texture. Let it rest before slicingJust like with any roasted meat, meatloaf needs to sit for a bit (about 10 minutes) so it can reabsorb the juices before you slice and serve.

I didn't have a meat thermometer, but the timing was perfect! My husband took one bite and said it tasted like his mom's! I think next time I will use half ground sirloin and half ground pork as another suggested..."" ""I made this tonight for my family and it was a great meatloaf! The only thing I changed on this recipe was I used ground turkey instead of ground beef. Anyway...this turkey meatloaf was absolutely fantastic! Oh yeah...one other thing I did was use a cup of seasoned bread crumbs instead of the sliced bread. My whole family said this was 'the best meatloaf I have ever made.'"" —JoJo Mandy says, ""My husband and I (who are NOT big meatloaf fans) loved the heck out of this recipe.

253,Good New Orleans Creole Gumbo,4.9,"(1,183)",949,1 hrs,2 hrs 40 mins,3 hrs 40 mins,20,20 servings,"New Orleans-style gumbo is a true taste of Southern tradition. This boldly flavored stew is bursting with fresh, filling ingredients like bell pepper, sausage, stewed tomatoes, and crabmeat. Hot sauce ad Cajun seasonings add a kick that makes this Lousiana dish a favorite amongst our community of home cooks. Learn how to make the best homestyle gumbo right here. Gumbo is one of the most famous dishes to result from Louisiana's shared Creole-Cajun heritage. Gumbo falls somewhere between a thick stew and a hearty soup and can contain ingredients such as chicken, sausage, ham, seafood, okra, tomatoes, and greens. As varied as the recipes can be, there are a few ingredients that all gumbos have in common: homemade stock; the ""holy trinity"" of celery, onions, and green peppers; and roux. Boldly delicious New Orleans-style gumbo is surprisingly easy to make at home. You'll find the full recipe below with step-by-step instructions, but here's what you can expect when you make this top-rated recipe: Great gumbo starts with roux, a flavorful thickening agent made from equal parts fat and flour. Once the roux is a deep golden color, add diced veggies and sausage to the mix. Then, incorporate beef bouillon, hot sauce, tomatoes, and seasonings to intensify the flavor. Let the gumbo simmer for 45 minutes before adding file powder, okra, and seafood. The result will be a lusciously hearty stew packed with Creole spice. Gumbo file, or file powder, is made from dried sassafras leaves. This ingredient was first used by Choctaw Indians and was later adopted by Acadians (Cajuns) when they arrived in the American South. Gumbo file has a deep, earthy flavor similar to thyme and should be added to gumbo in the last minutes of cooking — it helps to thicken and enrich the stew for an authentic taste of New Orleans. Leftover gumbo can be stored safely in the refrigerator for three to four days. Let the dish come to room temperature before placing it in an airtight container to enjoy later. Gently reheat on the stovetop for best results. ""This is one of the best gumbos I've ever had and my family is from the South so that is saying a lot — just don't tell my mother or grandmother,"" shares reviewer mellie18_99. ""I added shrimp, sausage, chicken, and crab meat."" ""This recipe is the real deal,"" raves home cook Pat. ""Don't forget the file gumbo at the very end, it makes a big difference.

BrothThis chicken noodle soup recipe calls for a mixture of chicken and vegetable broths. If you're short on time or ingredients, you can just use one or the other. Chicken Of course, you'll need chicken. If you have leftover rotisserie chicken, you can use that in place of the cooked chicken breasts for a budget-friendly shortcut. Noodles Make sure you don't add the noodles too early, as cooking them too long will make them mushy. CarrotsCarrots, which add a pop of bright color and flavor, are added at the end of cooking so they stay crisp.

Chicken noodle soup is a meal in and of itself, so you don't really need to pair it with any sides (besides maybe a few saltine crackers).

Thaw frozen shrimp before using.· Pasta: This recipe uses a 16-ounce package of linguine, but you can substitute the pasta of your choice, like angel hair pasta, fettuccine, or spaghetti.· Butter: Use unsalted butter. You can add salt to taste later in the recipe.· Extra-virgin olive oil: The flavor of the olive oil comes through in this recipe, so use the best quality.· Shallots and garlic: These aromatics add flavor and fragrance to shrimp scampi.· White wine: Use a dry, crisp white wine for shrimp scampi sauce. Pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc are good choices, and you can drink the leftover wine with dinner.· Lemon juice: Use freshly squeezed lemon juice for the best flavor.· Seasonings: Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper amplify the flavors, and a pinch of dried red pepper flakes give shrimp scampi a subtle kick. Use more red pepper flakes if you like things a bit more spicy.· Parsley: Fresh parsley adds eye-catching color and a bright, peppery flavor. The full recipe directions are below, but here are top tips for recipe success: · Prep ahead: Have all of your ingredients prepared and ready to cook before heating your skillet. You don't want to have to pause to cut, chop, squeeze, or measure right in the middle of a fast-moving recipe. If you use fresh shrimp, you can peel and devein the shrimp earlier in the day, then keep it chilled in the refrigerator until you're ready to get cooking.· Cook the pasta first: Boil the pasta in well-salted water, drain, and hold aside before cooking the shrimp scampi. You'll add the pasta to the hot skillet to warm it before serving. Time your cooking so you're ready to start cooking the shrimp immediately after the pasta is drained; you don't want the pasta to sit for too long.· Don't overcook the shrimp: It takes just a couple of minutes to cook raw shrimp, and if they cook for too long, shrimp turn tough and rubbery. You'll know the shrimp are close to done when they start to curl into a C shape and turn from translucent gray to opaque pink and white.

262,Simple Beef Stroganoff,4.1,(942),733,5 mins,15 mins,20 mins,4,,"Homemade stroganoff doesn't have to be hard! This simple ground beef stroganoff comes together in 20 minutes with just six ingredients. Beef stroganoff is an iconic Russian dish that consists of beef in a creamy sauce. According to legend, it was created by chefs who worked for the Stroganov family in the 1800s. The dish is often made with mushrooms and served over rice or egg noodles. Traditional beef stroganoff is made with steak, a roux-based sauce, and sauteed mushrooms. But, as the title suggests, this recipe is simplified. It relies on shortcut ingredients, such as ground beef and canned cream of mushroom soup, to keep the cook time down and to cut down on extra steps. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what can you can expect when you make this ground beef stroganoff: Saute ground beef until brown, then drain the fat. Add the canned soup and garlic powder. Simmer for about 10 minutes, then remove from heat. Stir cooked egg noodles and sour cream into the meat mixture. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Since this ground beef stroganoff is a rather heavy dish, you may not need a side dish at all. A simple side salad, though, is a great way to round out your meal and to add a pop of color. Of course, if you want something a little different, you could leave out the egg noodles and serve the ground beef and sauce mixture over white rice or mashed potatoes. Store leftover beef stroganoff in an airtight container in the fridge for up to four days. Reheat in the microwave or on the stove. Unfortunately, cooked egg noodles don't freeze well. If you'd like to freeze this ground beef stroganoff recipe, it's best to prepare it without the noodles. Freeze the beef-sauce mixture in a freezer-safe container for up to three months. Thaw on the stove and stir in cooked egg noodles before serving. ""My family loved this,"" says Amy Stewart.

275,Mom's Fabulous Chicken Pot Pie with Biscuit Crust,4.7,(820),656,20 mins,40 mins,1 hrs 10 mins,8,1 7x11-inch pot pie,"Hearty chicken pot pie is the ultimate comfort food. From the doughy biscuits down to the creamy chicken filling, pot pie is a family-favorite dinner. When you need a quick pot pie fix that doesn't require an actual pie crust, look to this recipe that uses store-bought shortcuts — like biscuit dough and rotisserie chicken — to make prep even easier. Here's what you'll need to make easy chicken pot pie with biscuits: ChickenUse store-bought rotisserie chicken or leftover cooked chicken for easy prep. Flaky-Style BiscuitsUse a can of your favorite biscuit dough. VegetablesThis pot pie is loaded with onions, celery, carrots, and peas. ButterSauté the vegetables in butter for extra flavor. Chicken BrothThis recipe calls for low-sodium chicken broth, but you can use any chicken broth you have on hand. Half-and-Half CreamHalf-and-half gives the filling its creamy texture. FlourFlour will coat the vegetables for a light fry, plus thicken the filling up. SpicesThis recipe calls for parsley, thyme, salt, and pepper. Egg YolkYou only need an egg yolk for an egg wash, so save the egg white for another recipe. You'll find the full instructions for this simple recipe below, but here's what you can expect: Cook the onion, celery, and carrots in a skillet with butter until tender. Stir in the peas, spices, and flour. Add the chicken broth and cream to the skillet. Cook until the sauce thickens, then add the chicken. Transfer the chicken pot pie filling to a baking dish and top with the biscuit dough. Brush the biscuits with an egg-water wash. Bake the pot pie until the biscuits are golden brown and the chicken filling is hot and bubbling. Because this recipe already calls for flour, your pot pie filling should be a great consistency. However, if you're having trouble getting the filling to thicken, you can simmer the sauce for a little bit longer. If that doesn't work (or if it's taking too long), you can also add a cornstarch slurry to the filling. Chicken pot pie with biscuits is a pretty hearty and heavy meal. It already has a nice balance of vegetables, protein, and carbs. But if you can't have dinner without a side, we suggest pairing it with a light salad to brighten up the savory flavors. Store the leftover biscuits and leftover chicken pot pie filling separately (so the biscuits don't get soggy). Place the biscuits in a zip-top bag and store in the refrigerator. Place chicken pot pie filling in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to four days. When you're ready to reheat, add the biscuits back on top. Then reheat in a skillet or in the oven. Yes, you can! Freeze the filling and biscuits separately or freeze the entire pot pie together. To freeze it separately: Store the cooked biscuits in a zip-top bag and pot pie filling in an airtight container or zip-top bag in the freezer for up to three months. Defrost in the fridge overnight, then assemble the pot pie before baking. To freeze together: Store the chicken pot pie with biscuits in an airtight container in the freezer for up to three months. Thaw in the fridge overnight. ""​​Very tasty and versatile. Use what you have! Hubby loved it and wants it in his lunch for work this week.

Store leftover stuffed shells in an airtight container in the fridge for up to four days. Reheat in the microwave. You can freeze both baked and unbaked stuffed shells. To freeze baked stuffed shells, simply place the leftover shells in an airtight container or zip-top freezer bag. Freeze for up to three months. Thaw in the fridge overnight. To freeze unbaked stuffed shells, assemble the shells in a baking dish, then wrap the entire dish (pan and all) with a layer of storage wrap, then a layer of foil. Freeze for up to three months. Thaw in the fridge overnight, then bake as directed. You may need to add extra time to the bake to account for the frozen temperature. ""Soooo good, definitely a keeper. I prepared it the night before (w/o baking) and just covered it and put it in the fridge.

287,Easiest Pot Roast Ever,4.4,(527),384,10 mins,4 hrs,4 hrs 10 mins,6,6 servings,"Looking for a deliciously hearty pot roast recipe that appeals to all palates? This simple Crock-Pot dish boasts a big flavor using just six ingredients. Enjoy a classic beef roast recipe that our community of home cooks comes back to again and again. Learn more about this mouthwatering roast recipe here, including how long to cook roast in the Crock-Pot and the best ways to serve it. Making delicious and comforting pot roast is easier than you think. You'll find the full recipe below with step-by-step instructions, but here's what you can expect when you make this top-rated recipe; Begin by cutting yellow onions, potatoes, and celery into sizable pieces and placing them in the slow cooker. Add in the roast, bouillon cubes, and water before cooking. Once done, the roast will be fork-tender with an intensely savory flavor. The cooking time for your pot roast will depend on your Crock-Pot's setting. A three-pound roast usually takes four to five hours to cook thoroughly. A lower, slower setting will take six to eight hours for the most tender finish. Using a bone-in cut will enhance flavor but extend the cooking time. Choose a marbled cut of beef for the best results — the richness from the fat will create a luscious flavor that's enhanced by the low and slow crockpot method. This incredibly easy pot roast recipe works well with a range of side dishes. Pair it with buttery herb biscuits,  rice pilaf, or a creamy squash casserole for a hearty and wholesome meal. Have leftovers you'd like to save for later? Cooked roast can be safely refrigerated in an airtight container for up to five days. Enjoy it cold or heated in the microwave or oven. Freezing leftover pot roast is just as easy — simply place meat (and some juice for added flavor) in a freezer-safe bag. Squeeze out excess air and freeze for up to three months. ""Very easy recipe,"" says Magi. ""I doctored it up with some fresh garlic and herbs. Last 15 minutes I threw in a can of mushrooms and the juice added to the gravy.

Shepherd's pie is a comfort food casserole that originated in England. It's traditionally made with minced meat (usually ground lamb), gravy, vegetables, and mashed potatoes. You may also hear it called ""cottage pie."" The two terms are used interchangeably, but technically traditional shepherd's pie is made with ground lamb and traditional cottage pie is made with ground beef. Shepherd's pie is made with fairly simple ingredients. Here's what you'll need: Ground BeefYou could also ground lamb if you prefer. Mashed PotatoesUse starchy potatoes (like russet or Yukon Gold) for the best mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes are also made with butter, onion, and Cheddar cheese. VegetablesThis shepherd's pie includes carrots and onions. FlourAll-purpose flour will thicken the beef gravy. KetchupKetchup will add a little tang to the ground beef mixture. Beef BrothBeef broth creates a gravy-like consistency in the middle. CheeseTop the shepherd's pie with extra Cheddar for a cheesy finish. Shepherd's pie may seem complicated, but it's actually quite simple to make. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's what you can expect when making this top-rated recipe: Boil the potatoes until tender, but still slightly firm.

Learn more: How To Make Shepherd's Pie One of the best parts about shepherd's pie? It's so hearty that it doesn't really need a side dish. However, if you can't go without a side (or two), we recommend serving this shepherd's pie with a light partner. Try a side salad or a vegetable side dish. Store shepherd's pie in an airtight container in the fridge for up to five days. Reheat in the oven or microwave until warmed through. Wrap the completely cooled shepherd's pie (baking dish and all) in a layer of storage wrap then a layer of aluminum foil. It's probably easier to bake the shepherd's pie in a disposable foil baking dish for easy freezing. Store the entire baking dish in the freezer for up to three months. Defrost in the fridge overnight, then reheat in the oven until warmed through. ""Outstanding! I am British and have been making Shepherd's Pie for years.

It would be good with any other veggies on hand as well,"" says one Allrecipes community member. ""My whole family likes this! It's a great comfort food or rainy night dinner. I added a little Worcestershire sauce to the meat after draining it, and I added a little milk to the mashed potatoes.

291,Old Charleston-Style Shrimp and Grits,4.9,"(1,149)",905,30 mins,45 mins,1 hrs 15 mins,8,8 servings,"Send your taste buds to coastal South Carolina with this restaurant-worthy shrimp and grits recipe. Whether you're a beginner cook or a seasoned pro, this top-rated recipe will impress everyone at your table. Shrimp and grits is a Southern dish from the Lowcountry of coastal South Carolina and Georgia. It's traditionally served at breakfast, but you can often find it on lunch or dinner menus. Nobody is quite sure when the ingredients were first served together, but the first known published recipe appeared in the 1950 edition of Charleston Receipts (the oldest Junior League cookbook still in print). You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect: Boil grits with half-and-half until thick, creamy, and tender. Remove from heat, set aside, and keep warm. A simple marinade of cayenne pepper, lemon juice, and salt makes perfectly flavorful shrimp that doesn't overpower the rest of the ingredients. Cook sausage in a skillet until brown. Remove the sausage from the skillet and replace with bacon. Cook bacon in the skillet until evenly browned, drain on paper towels, then chop or crumble when the bacon is cool enough to handle. Cook bell peppers, onion, and garlic in the bacon drippings. When veggies are tender, return the cooked sausage to the skillet along with the marinated shrimp. Whisk melted butter and flour over medium heat until you have a smooth, golden roux. Pour the roux over the sausage, shrimp, and vegetables in the skillet. Add chicken broth, bacon, and Worcestershire sauce to the skillet. Stir until sauce thickens and shrimp is bright pink. Finish the grits by mixing in Cheddar cheese. Spoon the grits onto plates, then top with the saucy shrimp mixture. While instant and quick grits are great when you're short on time, this recipe requires grits with a coarse grind. Choose stone-ground grits or coarse hominy grits for the best results. You don't necessarily have to serve anything with shrimp and grits. It's incredibly rich and satisfying by itself. However, if you want to go the extra mile, consider pairing this dish with Lowcountry fare (such as Okra and Tomatoes). Store shrimp and grits in separate airtight containers in the fridge. The grits will last for up to four days and the shrimp will last for up to two days. ""Amazing recipe,"" according to DKTRUM. ""I don't even usually like grits and I ate every bit of this recipe – two helpings. The seasonings were perfect and the depth of flavor was outstanding. Make this recipe as written and don't change a thing; you won't regret it."" ""Perfect recipe and my family loved it,"" raves Carly. ""Prep as much as you can ahead of time to make the process easier. I always bake my bacon instead of pan cooking (keeps the house from smelling) and add a bit of olive oil to the vegetables after cooking the sausage (because there is no bacon grease in the pan to cook it in)."" ""I loved this recipe,"" says DILLEAUX. ""Took some to my neighbor and she said it was the best dish I've ever cooked. I stayed relatively close to the recipe, but used less bell pepper.

420,French Toast,4.6,"(2,044)","1,431",5 mins,10 mins,15 mins,3,6 slices,"If you're looking for the best French toast recipe on the internet, you've come to the right place. This tender, fluffy, and indulgent recipe comes together quickly and easily with just five ingredients you already have on hand. How do you know it's good? Because this deliciously easy recipe has earned nearly 2,000 rave reviews from the Allrecipes community. Happy home cooks call it a ""definite keeper"" and ""a Sunday morning favorite"" (among many other ringing endorsements). Here's everything you need to know about making the best French toast of your life, including the best bread to use and what ingredients you need. Plus, get our best storage secrets and freezer hacks. It's easier than you think to make restaurant-quality French toast in the comfort of your own kitchen – you just need a skillet, a few staple ingredients, and a good recipe. That's where we come in! The best breads for French toast are brioche, sourdough, French bread, or challah. These varieties are dense and sturdy enough to handle total saturation in the wet, milky, egg custard without falling apart. However, in a pinch, any thick-sliced white bread will do. French toast is traditionally made with day-old slices because they absorb the eggy mixture better than fresh ones (and this method prevents waste – it's a win-win). Of course, a slightly stale loaf is certainly not a requirement. If you only have fresh bread on hand, that'll work just fine. Learn more: The 5 Best Breads For French Toast (And Bread Pudding) Every home cook has their own twist on basic French toast, but most variations contain the following ingredients: White BreadThick-cut bread is the base for all French toast. Sturdy, dense, slightly stale slices absorb the custard-like egg mixture better than thin, airy ones. EggsWhen it comes to French toast, eggs are essential. The proteins solidify once they're heated, which binds the batter together and ensures a rich texture. The fat, meanwhile, adds extra creaminess. MilkYou can technically use any liquid to make French toast, though milk is most popular. Not only does milk add the necessary moisture, but the fat gives the batter extra richness. This recipe calls for whole milk because it creates the ideal texture. You can easily substitute half-and-half, cream, or your favorite alternative milk – full-fat varieties will produce the creamiest consistency. Vanilla and CinnamonThe best French toast is warm, cozy, aromatic, and sweet. The cinnamon and vanilla in this recipe are optional, but we definitely recommend using them for the most delicious experience. You could even add a little nutmeg or sugar if you feel like it. SaltDon't skip the salt! Just a pinch won't affect the flavor. Salt helps break down the eggs, incorporate them into the batter, and prevents egg chunks in the finished product. ButterLike so many of the most decadent foods, the best French toast is made with butter. If your French toast has the tendency to burn, try frying the batter-soaked bread in a combination of butter and oil. Nope! French toast (pain perdu in French) isn't actually from France. Legend has it that a man named Joseph French from the U.S. created the sweet breakfast dish in 1724 and named it after himself. However, that's probably not true: People were frying milk- and egg-soaked bread in Ancient Rome, according to early recipes. It's more likely that modern French toast was invented by 15th-century cooks who were on a mission to use up stale bread. Let your leftover French toast cool completely, then place it in an airtight container (such as a zip-top bag or a reusable storage container). Store it in the fridge for about one to three days. Yes, you can freeze a big-batch of French toast for up to three months. Arrange the slices in a single layer on a baking sheet, freeze for at least four hours or up to overnight, then store frozen French toast in a freezer-safe container for two to three months. When you're ready to eat it, just throw it on a baking sheet and bake at 375°F until hot and cooked through, about 8-12 minutes. ""I used fresh French bread with this recipe,"" says ATOMICLUSH. ""It came out quite good. I added a little bit of sugar to the recipe to give it a little sweetness and I topped it off with powdered sugar!"" ""Fast and easy, and made with ingredients you already likely have in the house,"" raves JENNYDEVALL. ""This recipe is really good and easy, and you can even make it with cheap sandwich bread if that's all you have on hand,"" according to Bryan R. ""The key to this recipe is not to soak the bread too much. Put your slice in the mixing bowl, flip it right over, and then put it on the griddle. I experimented with soaking the bread more, and it ends up being soggy and undercooked.""

421,Banana Pancakes,4.5,"(2,616)","1,996",5 mins,10 mins,15 mins,6,12 pancakes,"Wake up on the right side of the bed with a stack of sweet, cozy, and simple banana pancakes. This top-rated banana pancake recipe is easy to make and it comes together in just 15 minutes, so you don't have to wake up early to enjoy a satisfying breakfast. Learn how to make, store, and serve the best banana pancakes ever. If you have ready-to-use bananas and a few kitchen staples, you already have everything you need to make perfect banana pancakes. FlourAll-purpose flour contains gluten, a protein that gives the pancakes structure and pleasant chewiness. SugarGranulated sugar adds sweetness, helps hold in moisture, and may create a tender texture. Baking PowderBaking powder is a leavener. It creates air bubbles in the batter, which ensures light and fluffy pancakes. SaltSalt adds subtle depth to all sorts of sweet dishes, including pancakes. You won't be able to detect it in the finished product, but you'll miss it if you leave it out. An EggEggs work with the other ingredients to bind and provide structure. The fatty yolks also add rich flavor and extra moisture. MilkNot only does milk add flavor, it is the liquid base that's essential for dissolving the dry ingredients and creating a cohesive batter. Vegetable OilVegetable oil is harder to burn than butter, so it's a great fat to use in banana pancakes. It keeps the pancakes moist and prevents them from sticking to the pan. BananasLast but certainly not least, you'll need two mashed bananas for these pancakes. The bananas will help hold the other ingredients together and add mellow, fruity flavor. It really couldn't be easier to make this basic banana pancake recipe. You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect: Combine your dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt, baking powder) in one bowl and your wet ingredients (egg, milk, vegetable oil, mashed bananas) in another bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the bowl with the wet ingredients, then stir until they're incorporated. It's OK if your batter is slightly lumpy. Pour the batter in ¼ cup portions onto a lightly oiled pan or griddle over medium-high heat. Cook for a few minutes, flip with a spatula, and cook for another few minutes (or until each side is golden brown). Serve your banana pancakes immediately. They're delicious alone or with your favorite pancake toppings. A plate full of plain banana pancakes is like a blank canvas. When it comes to toppings, you can keep it simple or get as creative as you want. If you're in need of a little inspiration, here are some of our favorite ideas: Maple Syrup or Pancake SyrupYou can't go wrong with the classics. As delicious as these banana pancakes are, a drizzle of maple or pancake syrup will send them over the top. Honey and Peanut ButterFor a more wholesome option, try topping your pancakes with honey. Dollop some peanut butter on there for a delicious, sandwich-inspired breakfast. Fruit and Whipped CreamAdd a little color to your breakfast plate with fresh berries, citrus wedges, or even some banana slices to really drive the theme home. Homemade or store-bought whipped cream is an extra special touch that pairs perfectly with fruit. Nutella Who says you can't eat dessert for breakfast? Top your banana pancakes with Nutella (or your favorite chocolate-hazelnut spread) for an indulgent morning treat. Jam or JellyA spoonful of jam or jelly is a fruity upgrade that everyone will love. Sprinkle it with powdered sugar for extra flavor. Don't throw away your extra pancakes! You can store them in an airtight container in the fridge for about two to three days. When you're ready to eat them, just reheat in the microwave until the pancakes are warmed through. Yes, you can freeze banana pancakes — and it's a great idea if you like to meal prep breakfasts. It couldn't be easier: Allow the pancakes to cool to room temperature, stack them in an airtight container with wax paper between each pancake (to prevent sticking), and freeze for about three months. There's no need to thaw frozen pancakes. Simply reheat them in the toaster, microwave, or oven. ""Just a tip for fuss free banana mashing ... stick them in a zip-lock bag, zip and squeeze,"" suggests a_houghtaling. ""When you're done, cut a corner off and you have a pour spout!""

431,Crispy Hash Browns,4.5,"(1,176)",885,20 mins,15 mins,35 mins,4,4 servings,"If you're a firm believer that potatoes make basically any meal taste better, then you've come to the right place. Because we are too — especially when it comes to breakfast potatoes. Choosing which type of breakfast potato to make can be a tough decision, but if you're craving crispy potatoes that remind you of your favorite restaurant, then you should try this hash brown recipe. The shredded potatoes are formed into pancake-like hash browns and lightly pan-fried for the perfect crispy texture that will pair deliciously with any breakfast dish. Believe it or not, making crispy hash browns is actually quite easy. First, shred your potatoes using your preferred method — either with a grater, food processor, or mandoline. Rinse the potatoes until the water is clear, then drain and squeeze out all the remaining liquid (this will ensure the hash browns are extra crispy). Next, you'll add in your binding agents (flour and egg) as well as any other ingredients or seasonings. This recipe only calls for onion, but you could also add cheese, cayenne pepper, or garlic to the mixture. Form your hash browns into patties (either one large hash brown or multiple smaller pancake-like hash browns) and pan fry them in oil, about five minutes on each side. To keep your hash browns crispy, make sure to heat the oil to sizzling before adding the patties and wait until the one side is golden brown before flipping. You can also make your hash browns thinner because they will get crispier and cook more evenly. If you care about the crisp, then you should use starchy potatoes, like russets or Idahoes. The only drawback is that the hash browns may be prone to falling apart because of the starchiness. So, if you want your hash brown to stick together easily, then you should use a waxy potato, like new potatoes, Yukon Golds, or red potatoes. These potatoes have more moisture and will stick together in the pan, however, they won't crisp up as nicely as starchy potatoes. The biggest culprit that's making your hash browns come apart is moisture. You need to make sure the potatoes are dry before adding them to the flour and egg mixture. Whether you squeeze them out in a dish towel or use a salad spinner, get the potatoes as dry as they can be. You can also use a different type of potato if you are worried about the hash browns breaking apart. If you use a waxy potato, they'll stick together nicely, but they won't get as crispy as you might want. Another option is to add more ingredients that will act as binders. Try adding cheese to your hash browns because when the cheese melts it will be like a gooey glue that holds your potatoes together. ""These turned out great! They weren't greasy at all, they held together perfectly, and they looked quite pretty when they were done cooking, too. Next time, I think I will add salt & pepper, plus some extra spices, to the shredded potato and egg/flour mixture, just to give it a more intense flavor. This recipe is so easy that I will have no problems just making these hash browns from memory, eyeballing the flour and spices,"" says eiskyjente. ""Unbelievable. About as good as one could hope for. Crispy on the outside, firm and tasty on the inside. And what a flavor. This will be my hash brown recipe from here on out. Make sure that you don't have too much oil in the pan. The hash browns will take forever to brown and may be too greasy for your taste,"" advises Curt McLey. ""My first try at making hash browns. Success. I added sharp Cheddar, a little garlic powder, a dash of oregano, and some green onions. I will keep this recipe and use it over and over. Always trying a little something different,"" raves MR BANANA.

436,Downeast Maine Pumpkin Bread,4.8,"(10,229)","7,739",15 mins,50 mins,1 hrs 5 mins,24,2 loaves,"When fall is in the air, can't you just smell a delicious loaf of freshly baked pumpkin bread? Or is that just those of us who dream about pumpkin bread all day? No matter. Either way, moist and flavorful pumpkin bread is the perfect way to use up the cans of pumpkin puree you stocked up on at the first sign of autumn. And what better recipe to use than this Downeast Maine Pumpkin Bread? It's so beloved by members of the Allrecipes community, they have rated it 5 stars over 8,000 times. The great news is that pumpkin bread is actually incredibly easy to make — you don't even need an electric mixer (though, of course it helps). Simply combine your wet ingredients, then combine your dry ingredients, then combine them all together. Pour into two loaf pans. The best part about this recipe is that it makes two loaves, so you can have one for now and one for later — or one for gifting! This recipe calls for canned pumpkin puree (make sure it's plain pumpkin, not pumpkin pie filling), which is quicker and easier than using fresh pumpkin. But, if you are feeling ambitious and want to use fresh pumpkin, follow this recipe to make pumpkin puree from scratch. A 1 ½-pound sugar pumpkin will make about 2 cups of mashed pumpkin, which is the same as a 15-ounce can of pumpkin puree. Pumpkin bread is pretty dense, so it might be hard to know when it's cooked all the way through (and the last thing you want is to serve up a bread that's raw in the middle). So, to know when pumpkin bread is done, look for the crack on the top of the bread, which is a tell-tale sign it's either done or close to being done. Then stick a skewer or toothpick into the center of the bread. If it comes out clean, it's ready to come out of the oven. If not, leave it to bake for a few more minutes, then check again with a clean toothpick. Sometimes removing quick breads from their loaf pan is a tricky task. So, before you add the batter, make sure you thoroughly grease the pan. Then, after you've let the bread cool for about 10 minutes (or until you can handle the pan), run a knife along the edges of the bread. Gently shake the pan until the bread comes loose and you can turn it out onto a wire rack or plate. Then, let the bread continue to cool. You may be tempted to cut right into the bread, but you should let it cool completely before slicing into it. Pumpkin bread may be an easy quick bread to make, but sometimes recipes don't always turn out as planned. If you're having one of these common mistakes, here's how to fix it: If you have a tough bread instead of a soft, cake-like texture, you're probably overmixing your batter. When making quick breads, you don't want to mix too much or else the gluten development will cause your bread to change in texture. Mix your ingredients until they are just combined — you should still have some lumps in the batter. Dry pumpkin bread is such a disappointment. To avoid dry, crumbly bread, try to keep your batter moist. Either do this by using less flour or adding more liquid — but don't add more oil. Instead, try adding orange juice or even bourbon to get some liquid into the batter. Wait until the bread is completely cool, then wrap it in plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Store it in a cool, dry place for up to four days, or in the refrigerator for up to one week. ""Awesome recipe!! Very easy to make. Just put in a bowl and use your hand or stand mixer. That simple. I just made it this morning and I tried it four hours later. Wonderful!!! Can't wait till tomorrow, I don't know how it can taste any better"" says KIMMIE5474. ""I can't even begin to describe this wonderful, cozy, comforting bread! There are no words! I made it exactly as stated and it was perfect!! End of story, no substitutions needed. It's like pumpkin pie for breakfast,"" raves Pamela Frechette. ""Our go-to recipe for pumpkin bread.

Tasting like pull-apart sticky buns, monkey bread is easy to make with everyday pantry ingredients, and can be customized with add-ins like dried fruits, nuts, and spices to suit your tastes. And with thousands of ratings and reviews, this is one of our best monkey bread recipes. I'll show you how to make this top-rated recipe for monkey bread, with plenty of how-to tips to guarantee success. Monkey bread is a pull-apart bread made with bite-size pieces of dough coated with sugar and spice and baked with a buttery brown sugar sauce in a tube or Bundt pan. To serve monkey bread, invert it onto a large plate and let everyone pull it apart into individual pieces with their fingers or forks. That's a good question without a definitive answer. Some say it's called monkey bread because you pick the bread apart with your fingers as though you're eating like a monkey, and some say it's because the baked monkey bread resembles the zigzag pattern of a monkey puzzle tree (Chilean pine). More: Our Best Monkey Bread Recipes of All Time These are the ingredients you'll need for this monkey bread recipe: · Biscuit dough: This recipe uses cut-up pieces of canned biscuit dough as a convenient shortcut ingredient.· Sugar and cinnamon: Used to coat biscuit dough pieces both for flavor and to make them easier to pull apart after baking. You can substitute other ground spices such as cardamom or a pumpkin spice blend.· Walnuts (optional): You could substitute pecans or leave out the nuts altogether.· Raisins (optional): You could substitute dried cranberries or other small bits of dried fruit.· Margarine and brown sugar: Combined and briefly boiled to create the sweet caramel-like sauce that holds the monkey bread together. Many reviewers use butter instead of margarine. Be sure to pack down the brown sugar firmly into the measuring cup to get the correct amount. Some home cooks recommend adding about ¼ cup cream or milk to help keep the sauce soft even after it cools. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this top-rated monkey bread: 1. Cut the biscuits into quarters and coat in cinnamon-sugar.2. Arrange the pieces in the pan. Add the raisins and nuts among the pieces if you're using them.3. Boil the brown sugar and margarine, then pour over the biscuits.4. Bake the monkey bread in the preheated oven. Get more tips for How to Make Monkey Bread. Monkey bread is meant to be pulled apart and eaten with fingers or forks. There's no need to cut and slice. It's best when served warm and the sauce is still soft and sticky, but it's good eaten cold as well. We recommend using a Bundt pan or one-piece tube pan to make monkey bread because the shape of the pan allows hot air to circulate to the middle of the bread and bake the dough evenly. But if you don't have a Bundt or tube pan, you can make monkey bread in a large loaf pan, cake pan, or 9x13 pan. Use a large enough pan to allow for the biscuits to expand. You may have to adjust your baking time so the biscuit pieces are fully baked in the center of the monkey bread. Monkey bread can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for three or four days. You can wrap and freeze baked monkey bread for up to three months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator. ""Fun to make & delicious to eat! I cut the recipe into ⅓ and only used 1 can of biscuits in an 8"" round cake pan. Cooked for about 20 minutes. My 2½-year-old enjoyed helping me roll the balls. Also, previous reviewer suggested using a pizza cutter to cut the biscuits —great shortcut,"" says Allrecipes home cook BBURG_HOKIES. Reviewer Stephanie C offers this tip: ""Scrumptious! I used frozen yeast roll dough to get a more homemade yeast bread flavor and the results were outstanding! You can make it the night before this way: Thaw 18 golf ball-size raw yeast rolls over about an hour. Once thawed, cut each in half. Follow the recipe for coating and layering. After pouring the brown sugar mixture over dough, place in cold oven overnight to rise. Follow baking instructions in the morning. Absolutely perfect! The entire extended family loved it!"" ""The only tips I could offer would be to make sure you don't press down on the dough balls once you get them in the pan, or else the sauce won't make it all the way through the loaf and get it all gooey and delicious on the inside. Also, I'd make about 50 percent more sauce than the recipe calls for, because people seem to go for the parts that have the most sauce,"" says reviewer JenniJ3333.

This tried-and-true recipe is beloved by the Allrecipes community because it's easy to make with just five ingredients, it calls for kitchen staples you probably already have on hand, and it's absolutely delicious. Here's what you'll need to make this top-rated biscuit recipe: FlourAll-purpose flour holds the ingredients together. Also, the protein in flour (when combined with moisture and heat) creates gluten, which provides structure. Baking PowderBaking powder, not yeast, is used as a leavener in this easy biscuit recipe. It causes the dough to expand, giving the biscuits volume and texture. SaltSalt acts as a flavor enhancer and it strengthens the protein in the dough. ShorteningShortening is made of purely fat, unlike butter which contains water and milk solids. This means it's better at reducing (or ""shortening!"") gluten strands, resulting in a soft and crumbly biscuit. MilkCold milk adds moisture, flavor, and structure to the biscuit dough. You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect: Sift the dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, and salt) into a large bowl. Cut in the shortening, then add the milk. Mix until the dough is soft and doesn't stick to the side of the bowl. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly. Roll the dough into an even sheet that's about ½-inch thick. Use a lightly floured biscuit cutter to cut out the biscuits. Place the cut biscuits on an ungreased baking sheet. Re-roll the dough, repeating the cutting process, until all the dough is gone. Bake in an oven preheated to 450 degrees F until golden brown. Top your biscuits with homemade sausage gravy, jam, honey butter, or the spread of your choice. You can also pair them with breakfast meats — such as bacon, sausage, or chicken — or serve them with a hearty soup or stew (you can't go wrong with a classic beef stew).

This microwave method is hands-off (compared to the traditional stovetop method) and comes together in just a few minutes with three ingredients. What more could you ask for in a shortcut recipe? There are plenty of ways to cook eggs in the microwave, but this method for scrambled eggs is perhaps our favorite.

Every microwave is different. The process could take anywhere from 1 minute to 2.5 minutes. Just be sure to microwave in 30-second intervals and to beat the eggs between every interval – this way, the eggs will scramble evenly and won't be overcooked.

This super simple scone recipe is as approachable as it is irresistible. The word ""scone"" can mean slightly different things depending on where you're located. American scones (like the ones this recipe makes!) are typically sweet, dense, and dry. They're usually triangular and can contain mix-ins like chocolate chips, berries, or nuts. This bakery-worthy scone recipe is easy to make with basic ingredients you likely already have on hand. If not, here's what to add to your grocery list: · Flour: This scone recipe starts with all-purpose flour.· Sugar: You'll need white sugar for the dough and to top the scones.· Leaveners: Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the scones rise.· Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor of the scones.· Butter: Make sure the butter is frozen before you incorporate it into the dough for the flakiest results.· Raisins: You can also use dried currants.· Sour cream: Sour cream lends moisture and subtle tangy flavor.· Egg: An egg adds moisture and helps bind the scone dough together. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make scones at home: 1. Mix the dry ingredients, then work the butter into the dough using your fingers.2. Add the raisins.3. Whisk the sour cream and egg together.4. Stir the egg mixture into the flour mixture.5. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and pat into a circle.6. Sprinkle the dough with sugar and cut it into triangles.7. Bake the scones in a preheated oven until golden brown. Mix it up with one of these variations on the basic scone recipe: · For Cranberry-Orange Scones: Add a generous teaspoon of finely grated orange zest to the dry ingredients and substitute dried cranberries for the raisins.· For Lemon-Blueberry Scones: Add a generous teaspoon of finely grated lemon zest to the dry ingredients and substitute dried blueberries for the raisins.· For Cherry-Almond Scones: Add 1/2 teaspoon almond extract to the sour cream mixture and substitute dried cherries for the raisins. Store the cooled scones in an airtight container at room temperature for up to two days or in the fridge for up to one week. Flash freeze the scones on a baking sheet for a few hours or up to overnight. Transfer the frozen scones to a freezer-safe container and freeze for up to three months.

These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated bran muffin recipe: · Wheat bran: You'll usually find wheat bran in the grain section of the grocery store, near the flour.· Buttermilk: Buttermilk lends moisture, flavor, and contributes to the light and fluffy texture.· Brown sugar: This bran muffin recipe calls for brown sugar instead of white sugar, which gives it a warm sweetness.· Vegetable oil: A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, adds moisture without imparting flavor.· Egg: An egg lends even more moisture and helps bind the muffin batter together.· Vanilla: A dash of vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the muffins.· Flour: All-purpose flour creates structure and helps bring the batter together.· Leaveners: Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the muffins rise.· Salt: Salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but they won't make the muffins taste salty.· Raisins: Raisins add bursts of sweet flavor, but you can leave them out if you like. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make bran muffins at home: 1. Mix the wheat bran and buttermilk. Let the mixture stand.2. Beat the remaining wet ingredients together, then stir them into the buttermilk mixture.3. Add the dry ingredients. Fold in the raisins.4. Spoon the batter into a prepared muffin tin.5.

452,Crustless Spinach Quiche,4.7,"(3,294)","2,426",15 mins,35 mins,50 mins,6,1 9-inch quiche,"Cheesy, savory quiche is the perfect addition to any brunch menu. It's easy to make, takes less than an hour, and it's a crowd favorite. When you're in need of a crustless quiche that will brighten up your breakfast or brunch, turn to this tried-and-true recipe. Here's what you'll need to make this top-rated crustless quiche: EggsBecause this quiche doesn't have a crust, you'll need five eggs to hold the mixture together. SpinachFrozen spinach (thawed and squeezed dry) works best, but you can use fresh spinach if that's all you have on hand. OnionA yellow or white onion adds a depth of flavor to the quiche. Muenster CheeseMuenster is a mild cheese that melts well and will add a delicious flavor cheesy to the quiche. SpicesSimple salt and pepper is all you need. While a crustless quiche and a frittata are made up of similar ingredients (eggs, dairy, and add-ins), they are different things. The main difference comes from the baking techniques. Quiches are baked like tarts, in a pie pan in the oven. While frittatas are first cooked like an open-faced omelet in a cast-iron skillet, and then transferred to the oven for the last few minutes of the bake. Learn more: What's the Difference Between a Frittata, a Quiche, and a Strata? You'll find the full step-by-step recipe below, but here's what you can expect when you make this crustless quiche: Sauté the onions until soft, then add the spinach and cook until wilted. Whisk eggs, salt, and pepper in a bowl until combined. Add the cheese and spinach mixture to the eggs. Pour the quiche mixture into a pie pan and bake until the eggs are cooked through and have set. If your quiche is coming out wet and not set, it's because your ingredients weren't dry enough. You need to make sure all the moisture is gone from the add-ins (in this case onions and spinach) before you put them in the quiche. To fix a watery quiche, make sure your ingredients are dry, plus bake the quiche on the middle rack and be sure not to over or under bake it. The quiche should be slightly jiggly, but not runny. This crustless quiche bakes for 35 minutes, which should be the perfect amount of time for the eggs to set without fear of overbaking. The bake time for crustless quiche can vary depending on the size of the eggs you used. However, this recipe calls for 35 minutes in the oven, which should give you a perfectly set quiche every time. Store crustless quiche in an airtight container in the fridge for up to four days. Reheat in the oven or in the microwave. Wrap the completely cooled quiche in a layer of plastic wrap, then a layer of aluminum foil. For another layer of protection, you can place it in a zip-top freezer bag labeled with the date. Store crustless quiche in the freezer for up to three months. Thaw in the fridge overnight. ""I used sharp cheddar for this recipe. Other than that, I followed it exactly and it was DELICIOUS! This is definitely going into my recipe rotation,"" says JDRABIK. ""My hubs and 14yo son are gobbling it up! I used fresh spinach with a pinch of nutmeg and added an extra egg.

I made it today and my 9 year old daughter almost ate the entire thing.

458,Old Charleston-Style Shrimp and Grits,4.9,"(1,149)",905,30 mins,45 mins,1 hrs 15 mins,8,8 servings,"Send your taste buds to coastal South Carolina with this restaurant-worthy shrimp and grits recipe. Whether you're a beginner cook or a seasoned pro, this top-rated recipe will impress everyone at your table. Shrimp and grits is a Southern dish from the Lowcountry of coastal South Carolina and Georgia. It's traditionally served at breakfast, but you can often find it on lunch or dinner menus. Nobody is quite sure when the ingredients were first served together, but the first known published recipe appeared in the 1950 edition of Charleston Receipts (the oldest Junior League cookbook still in print). You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect: Boil grits with half-and-half until thick, creamy, and tender. Remove from heat, set aside, and keep warm. A simple marinade of cayenne pepper, lemon juice, and salt makes perfectly flavorful shrimp that doesn't overpower the rest of the ingredients. Cook sausage in a skillet until brown. Remove the sausage from the skillet and replace with bacon. Cook bacon in the skillet until evenly browned, drain on paper towels, then chop or crumble when the bacon is cool enough to handle. Cook bell peppers, onion, and garlic in the bacon drippings. When veggies are tender, return the cooked sausage to the skillet along with the marinated shrimp. Whisk melted butter and flour over medium heat until you have a smooth, golden roux. Pour the roux over the sausage, shrimp, and vegetables in the skillet. Add chicken broth, bacon, and Worcestershire sauce to the skillet. Stir until sauce thickens and shrimp is bright pink. Finish the grits by mixing in Cheddar cheese. Spoon the grits onto plates, then top with the saucy shrimp mixture. While instant and quick grits are great when you're short on time, this recipe requires grits with a coarse grind. Choose stone-ground grits or coarse hominy grits for the best results. You don't necessarily have to serve anything with shrimp and grits. It's incredibly rich and satisfying by itself. However, if you want to go the extra mile, consider pairing this dish with Lowcountry fare (such as Okra and Tomatoes). Store shrimp and grits in separate airtight containers in the fridge. The grits will last for up to four days and the shrimp will last for up to two days. ""Amazing recipe,"" according to DKTRUM. ""I don't even usually like grits and I ate every bit of this recipe – two helpings. The seasonings were perfect and the depth of flavor was outstanding. Make this recipe as written and don't change a thing; you won't regret it."" ""Perfect recipe and my family loved it,"" raves Carly. ""Prep as much as you can ahead of time to make the process easier. I always bake my bacon instead of pan cooking (keeps the house from smelling) and add a bit of olive oil to the vegetables after cooking the sausage (because there is no bacon grease in the pan to cook it in)."" ""I loved this recipe,"" says DILLEAUX. ""Took some to my neighbor and she said it was the best dish I've ever cooked. I stayed relatively close to the recipe, but used less bell pepper.

Say ""goodbye"" to store-bought cinnamon buns forever — you'll be making this recipe until the end of time. Cinnamon buns, also called cinnamon rolls, originated in Europe. They were brought to America by German and Swedish immigrants and have since become a sweet breakfast staple across the country. You'll find the step-by-step recipe below, but here's what you can expect when making these cinnamon buns: Activate the yeast by combining water, sugar, and yeast. Let stand until the mixture is foamy. Then combine, warm milk, sugar, butter, and salt until melted. Add both the milk and yeast mixtures to a bowl with eggs and flour. Mix until a dough forms. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead until smooth. Place dough in an oil-coated bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Allow to rise until the dough has doubled in size. Mix butter and brown sugar in a saucepan over medium heat until smooth. Pour glaze into a greased baking pan and top with ½ cup of pecans. Melt butter and set it aside. Combine brown sugar, pecans, and cinnamon in another bowl. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and roll it into a rectangle. Brush the dough with butter, then sprinkle with the filling mixture. Roll the dough tightly into a spiral and top with the rest of the melted butter. Cut the dough into equal-sized cinnamon buns and place them in the pan with the glaze (cut-side down). Cover the pan and let the buns rise until doubled in size. Bake the cinnamon buns until golden brown. Invert the pan so the glaze is on the top. Add any remaining glaze from the pan to the cinnamon buns.

466,Buttermilk Pancakes,4.7,"(3,870)","3,016",15 mins,10 mins,25 mins,12,12 to 5 - inch pancakes,"As convenient as a store-bought mix can be, every home cook needs a good buttermilk pancake recipe in their repertoire. Don't have a tried-and-true favorite yet? You're in luck! The Allrecipes community can't get enough of these classic buttermilk pancakes. Reviewers say they're light, fluffy, moist, and full of rich flavor. You probably already have everything required to make this top-rated buttermilk pancake recipe. Here's what you'll need: · Flour: All-purpose flour contains gluten, which gives the buttermilk pancakes structure and pleasant chewiness.· Sugar: Just three tablespoons ofwhite sugar should be enough to lend subtle sweetness. Remember, you'll be adding a lot more sugar if you top the pancakes with syrup or molasses!· Leaveners: Baking powder and baking soda act as leaveners (a substance that releases gas when mixed with other ingredients, causing the batter to rise to fluffy perfection).· Salt: You definitely don't want to skip adding a small amount of salt — the buttermilk pancakes will taste bland without it.· Buttermilk: Of course, you'll need buttermilk for buttermilk pancakes! This recipe calls for three whole cups.· Milk: Wholemilk helps create the perfect batter consistency and cuts some of the buttermilk's acidity.· Eggs: Three whole eggs add structure and rich flavor to the buttermilk pancakes.· Butter: Meltedbutter lends flavor and keeps the pancakes nice and moist. No buttermilk? No problem! Make our top-rated buttermilk substitute with just regular milk and lemon juice. It's really quite easy to make perfect buttermilk pancakes at home. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what to expect: 1. Mix the dry ingredients: Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.2. Mix the wet ingredients: Beat the buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl. Do not combine the wet and dry ingredients until right before you cook the pancakes.3. Make the pancakes: Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix with a wooden spoon or fork until the mixtures are just-blended. Scoop the batter onto a hot, oiled griddle and cook until the pancake is bubbly on the top. Flip with a spatula and cook until both sides are brown. ""Stop buying boxed pancake mix,"" says culinary producer Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. NicoleMcMom). ""You've got everything you need to make them on hand."" Here are a few of her favorite tips and tricks for making perfect buttermilk pancakes: · If you don't have a griddle, you can just as easily use a large nonstick or cast iron skillet.· The most important part of cooking pancakes is knowing when to flip them. When the whole surface is covered in bubbles, it's time to flip.· If you want to add chocolate chips or berries, toss them onto the pancakes right before you flip them — this way they'll stay mostly intact. There's nothing like plain buttermilk pancakes topped with maple syrup. But, if you're in the mood to add something extra to your breakfast, you can! Optional mix-ins include chocolate chips, berries, and nuts. You could also add cinnamon and vanilla to the batter for a little extra warmth. Instead of syrup, you could top your buttermilk pancakes with jam or honey for a sweet twist on a classic. Yes! You can freeze the cooked buttermilk pancakes. Simply flash freeze them on a baking sheet, then transfer them to a freezer-bag labeled with the date. Freeze for two months. Reheat in the toaster, in the microwave, or in the oven. For the fluffiest results, you shouldn't mix the dry ingredients with the wet ingredients until right before you plan to cook — so this buttermilk pancake recipe does not freeze well. Luckily, it's super easy to make this batter the day you plan to serve the pancakes. ""Absolutely fantastic,"" raves sheryl. ""The pancakes are incredibly light and fluffy. I will never again buy a box mix. Definitely a keeper!"" ""Awesome recipe,"" says Julie Satterthwaite. ""6 out of 5 stars! Would recommend making them with 1/4 measuring cup size rather than 1/2 cup, so the middle gets done without overbrowning the pancake.""

More: The Best Potato Salads From Around the World Most of the work that goes into making this potato salad recipe is preparing the ingredients. After that, you simply combine them gently in a large bowl, cover, and chill to let the flavors develop. The best potato salads are a balance of flavors and textures, where creamy, tangy, sweet, salty, tender, and crunchy meet in perfect harmony. Here are the ingredients for this top-rated potato salad recipe: PotatoesIt's not potato salad without potatoes. The recipe doesn't specify what size potatoes or what kind, so choose medium-size potatoes, or enough to serve eight. As far as what kind of potatoes to use for potato salad, I'll cover that in the next section. EggsHard-boiled eggs are a must-have for this kind of old-fashioned potato salad, but you can leave them out if you really want to. CeleryCelery adds a crunchy element to balance the softer texture and creaminess of the potatoes. OnionYou can use any onion you like, including yellow, white, or red onions. Chop the onion into small, uniform pieces so no one bites into a big chunk of raw onion. RelishUse your favorite sweet pickle relish. Some reviewers chopped up sweet gherkin pickles, or substitute relish or pickles that are less sweet. MayonnaiseThis is the creamy element that brings all the ingredients together. For best results, mix the mayonnaise, mustard, relish, and seasonings together in a separate bowl. Give it a taste test and adjust the seasonings before adding to the potatoes, eggs, and onion.

The recipe does not specify what kind of potatoes to use, but here are some guidelines to help you choose the best potatoes for potato salad so you get the results you're looking for. Waxy potatoes, like red potatoes and fingerling potatoes, have a smooth texture and will hold their shape even after boiling. And with their thin, delicate skins, they might not even need peeling. Use waxy potatoes if you like firm potatoes in your potato salad. Starchy potatoes, like Idahos or Russets, break down when they're boiled but their starchy texture soaks up dressing beautifully. Use starchy potatoes if you like softer creamier potatoes in your potato salad, but you'll have to peel them because of their thicker skins. All-purpose potatoes, like Yukon Golds, hit the sweet spot between waxy and starchy potatoes, and are reliable choices for potato salad. This recipe for Old-Fashioned Potato Salad instructs you to boil unpeeled potatoes in salted water until they're tender but still firm. You'll drain them and let them cool a bit, then peel and chop into bite-sized pieces. (Boiling helps the potato skins slip off easily.) Depending on how large your potatoes are, boiling could take between 10 to 15 minutes or more. Start testing for doneness at about 10 minutes by piecing a potato with a sharp paring knife. If it slides in easily all the way to the center of the potato, the potato is cooked and ready to drain. Flavor-boosting tipPotatoes have a very mild flavor on their own; that's why you add salt to the boiling water. To add even more flavor to the boiled potatoes, lay them out on a rimmed baking sheet after peeling and chopping, and while they're still warm. Sprinkle them with a little vinegar, salt, and pepper. Let the potatoes cool until they're not steaming anymore, then proceed with the rest of the recipe. More: How to Make the Best Potato Salad Potato salad should be covered and stored in the refrigerator. Do not let potato salad sit at room temperature for more than two hours, or even less on a warm day. If you're serving potato salad at a picnic or BBQ, place the serving bowl in a bed of ice to keep it very cool. Properly wrapped and chilled, potato salad will last in the refrigerator for three or four days. Yes, you can freeze potato salad. For best results, cool it completely then spoon it into an airtight freezer bag and lay it flat. Squeeze out as much air as you can without crushing the potato salad. If you have a lot of potato salad to freeze, use two or more bags. Thinner layers are best both for freezing and thawing. Properly frozen potato salad will last in the freezer for up to three months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight. You might have to add a little more dressing before serving potato salad that has been frozen and thawed. ""We love this recipe, says Allrecipes home cook cakesnthings. ""I have made it several times. The only thing that I do differently is use sweet pickles chopped up instead of using sweet relish.

484,"Marinated Cucumber, Onion, and Tomato Salad",4.7,(659),516,15 mins,,2 hrs 15 mins,6,6 servings,"There's a lot to love about this top-rated cucumber tomato salad recipe. It's inexpensive to make using everyday ingredients, it's a crisp and refreshing side dish that goes with just about anything, and it has make-ahead convenience built right in. Let's dive into this dish and see why Allrecipes home cooks award it a solid 5-stars. This recipe for Marinated Cucumber, Onion, and Tomato Salad has most of the ingredients right there in the title. Cool, crisp cucumbers and juicy ripe tomatoes are teamed up with onions in a satisfying mix of flavor and texture. But what pulls this dish together is the tart and tangy salad dressing made of water, vinegar, oil, sugar, salt, and pepper. It takes only 15 minutes to prep the salad itself: Whisk the ingredients for the dressing, peel and slice the cucumbers, cut the tomatoes into wedges, slice the onion into rings, and place everything together in a bowl. After that, it goes into the refrigerator to marinate for at least two hours so the dressing can work its magic to enhance and balance all the flavors. That marination step means you can make this salad well ahead of time and stash it in the fridge until you're ready to dish it up. CucumbersChoose firm cucumbers with smooth, firm skins and no soft spots. Cucumbers lose water quickly after they're picked and will start to show shrinking and wrinkling if they've been in storage for too long. TomatoesThis recipe doesn't specify what kind of tomatoes to use, but you'll want to choose the ripest, tastiest tomatoes you can find. Heirloom tomatoes have the best flavor, but unless you grow them yourself, they can be pricier than the everyday tomatoes from your supermarket. You can use cherry tomatoes or Roma tomatoes, too. Whichever tomato variety you choose, get the best you can afford because the flavor of the tomatoes play a starring role. If you do use smaller tomatoes, be sure to slice them so the marinade can soak in and do its work. Read more: How to Pick the Best Tomatoes OnionsYou can use any onion you like for this recipe: yellow, white, or red. Each brings a different flavor profile to the mix. Yellow onions are inexpensive, easy to find, and have a predictable onion flavor. White onions are a bit sweeter and milder than yellow onions. Red onions are a little spicier than yellow onions, and carry their bright color through to the salad. Sweet onions are pricier, and as the name suggests, their flavor is milder and naturally sweeter. Read more: What's the Difference Between White, Yellow, and Red Onions? VinegarThe recipe lists distilled white vinegar, but here again you can substitute other vinegars to suit your taste. Some Allrecipes home cooks who made this recipe used white wine vinegar, apple cider vinegar, Champagne vinegar, rice wine vinegar, and white balsamic vinegar. Read more: The Difference Between the Six Most Popular Types of Vinegar OilVegetable oil is called out in this recipe, and it's a good choice because of its neutral flavor. But you can also use good quality olive oil if you prefer, as some reviewers did. Properly covered and chilled, cucumber tomato salad will last 3-5 days in the refrigerator. The cucumbers might lose a little crispness after a couple of days depending on their freshness when you used them and how thickly you sliced them. The onions will continue to mellow and take up the sweet and tart flavors of the dressing. The tomatoes should still be juicy and flavorful, although their structure may break down a bit as they soak. The real question is, what doesn't go with cucumber tomato salad? This crisp, light, sweet, tart, crunchy, juicy salad is a perfect side dish for everything from grilled foods and fried foods to saucy BBQ dishes and everyday picnic sandwiches. Cucumber tomato salad provides a snappy contrast to creamy potato, macaroni, or pasta salads, and can hold its own in any potluck buffet. ""Super easy recipe. Love it,"" says Allrecipes home cook Bethany Idontwanttouseit. ""Followed advice of some others and made with apple cider vinegar. Delicious. Also used a sweet onion since it didn't specify. I found that the longer it marinated, the better it was."" Reviewer Jimdchimp9 says, ""Big hit this summer! Made it a couple times. Second time I used a little less water but it is great. I made it again today for a church get together and was asked by a few people for this recipe."" ""Just made this and WOW! Love it. Wo delicious. I used Vidalia onion and cherry tomatoes.

540,Baked Kale Chips,4.5,"(2,628)","1,994",10 mins,20 mins,30 mins,6,6 servings,"Imagine being able to munch as many crunchy snacks as you want while you're binging that show you love without feeling guilty later. That's the beauty of these homemade baked kale chips. Made by quickly tossing together three simple ingredients – fresh kale, olive oil, and flaked sea salt – and baked low and slow for only 20 minutes, these crispy kale chips are easy to make, there are no mystery additives, and even fussy eaters snap them up. As easy as kale chips are to make, there are still a couple of tips to keep in mind for best results: Dry leaves completelyThe key to crispy kale chips is to make sure you thoroughly dry your kale leaves. Use paper towels or a dry dish towel to remove any drops of water that might remain after washing and spinning your kale. Damp leaves make soggy kale chips. Don't overdo the oilUse a light hand when you coat the dry kale leaves with olive oil. You don't want to drench them or they'll never crisp up. Spread outUse a large enough rimmed baking sheet so each kale leaf can lie flat in a single layer. Leaves that are bunched up or folded over won't crisp evenly. Bake in batches if you need to. Don't overbakeWhen it comes to baked kale chips, brown equals bitter. That's why it can be a little tricky to know when your kale chips are fully baked because you can't really judge by the color. You want to remove baked kale chips from the oven before they brown but while they're still a bit soft in the center. But don't worry; they will continue to crisp up after you take them out of the oven and let cool. For perfectly crispy baked kale chips, you might have to do a little trial and error to find the right balance. Any variety of kale – curly or flat – can be made into baked kale chips. Some home cooks prefer to use flat lacinato kale, aka ""dinosaur"" kale, so named for its leathery appearance, and some like the frilly appearance of curly kale. Try batches of both and see which you like best. If you don't eat them all in one go, you'll want to store baked kale chips the right way so they stay crisp and don't get mushy. Here's how to store homemade baked kale chips: Let them coolBaked kale chips fresh from the oven still give off enough moisture to make baked kale chips soggy. Let them cool completely before storing them. Airtight is just rightMost baked kale chip recipes that are flavored with salt or other dry seasonings can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week, although it's best to eat them within two or three days. Baked kale chips seasoned with something perishable like cheese should be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Once you master the basics of making baked kale chips, you can explore other flavorings. Try spicy Sriracha-Lime Kale Chips, tangy Salt and Vinegar Kale Chips, and sweet Maple Kale Crisps.

543,Crispy Hash Browns,4.5,"(1,176)",885,20 mins,15 mins,35 mins,4,4 servings,"If you're a firm believer that potatoes make basically any meal taste better, then you've come to the right place. Because we are too — especially when it comes to breakfast potatoes. Choosing which type of breakfast potato to make can be a tough decision, but if you're craving crispy potatoes that remind you of your favorite restaurant, then you should try this hash brown recipe. The shredded potatoes are formed into pancake-like hash browns and lightly pan-fried for the perfect crispy texture that will pair deliciously with any breakfast dish. Believe it or not, making crispy hash browns is actually quite easy. First, shred your potatoes using your preferred method — either with a grater, food processor, or mandoline. Rinse the potatoes until the water is clear, then drain and squeeze out all the remaining liquid (this will ensure the hash browns are extra crispy). Next, you'll add in your binding agents (flour and egg) as well as any other ingredients or seasonings. This recipe only calls for onion, but you could also add cheese, cayenne pepper, or garlic to the mixture. Form your hash browns into patties (either one large hash brown or multiple smaller pancake-like hash browns) and pan fry them in oil, about five minutes on each side. To keep your hash browns crispy, make sure to heat the oil to sizzling before adding the patties and wait until the one side is golden brown before flipping. You can also make your hash browns thinner because they will get crispier and cook more evenly. If you care about the crisp, then you should use starchy potatoes, like russets or Idahoes. The only drawback is that the hash browns may be prone to falling apart because of the starchiness. So, if you want your hash brown to stick together easily, then you should use a waxy potato, like new potatoes, Yukon Golds, or red potatoes. These potatoes have more moisture and will stick together in the pan, however, they won't crisp up as nicely as starchy potatoes. The biggest culprit that's making your hash browns come apart is moisture. You need to make sure the potatoes are dry before adding them to the flour and egg mixture. Whether you squeeze them out in a dish towel or use a salad spinner, get the potatoes as dry as they can be. You can also use a different type of potato if you are worried about the hash browns breaking apart. If you use a waxy potato, they'll stick together nicely, but they won't get as crispy as you might want. Another option is to add more ingredients that will act as binders. Try adding cheese to your hash browns because when the cheese melts it will be like a gooey glue that holds your potatoes together. ""These turned out great! They weren't greasy at all, they held together perfectly, and they looked quite pretty when they were done cooking, too. Next time, I think I will add salt & pepper, plus some extra spices, to the shredded potato and egg/flour mixture, just to give it a more intense flavor. This recipe is so easy that I will have no problems just making these hash browns from memory, eyeballing the flour and spices,"" says eiskyjente. ""Unbelievable. About as good as one could hope for. Crispy on the outside, firm and tasty on the inside. And what a flavor. This will be my hash brown recipe from here on out. Make sure that you don't have too much oil in the pan. The hash browns will take forever to brown and may be too greasy for your taste,"" advises Curt McLey. ""My first try at making hash browns. Success. I added sharp Cheddar, a little garlic powder, a dash of oregano, and some green onions. I will keep this recipe and use it over and over. Always trying a little something different,"" raves MR BANANA.

If it sounds too good to be true, try this crowd-pleasing side dish for yourself — you'll be shocked at its simplicity. This recipe for kale is incredibly easy to make with just three ingredients: KaleChoose sturdy kale that's evenly green and free of yellow or brown spots. The leaves should be crisp and unwilted. GarlicA teaspoon of minced garlic adds just the right amount of flavor. You can keep it simple or add salt, pepper, and/or other seasonings to taste. OilThe kale is cooked in olive oil until bright green and tender. You'll need to thoroughly clean the kale before you cook it. To prepare kale for cooking, simply soak the leaves in a large bowl of water until the grit sinks to the bottoms. Lift the leaves out and repeat the process with clean water if they're particularly dirty. What you do next will depend on the recipe. For this one, immediately discard the stems and chop the kale into 1-inch pieces. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's what you can expect when you make this incredibly easy garlic kale recipe: Heat olive oil in a skillet. Stir in garlic and cook until sizzling. Add kale to the skillet, toss, cover, and cook (tossing occasionally with tongs) until the kale is tender and vibrant green. Let your leftovers cool to room temperature, then place them in a shallow airtight container. Store in the fridge for up to five days.

Find out what all the fuss is about with this top-rated recipe. Here's what you'll need to make this top-rated Buffalo chicken dip with canned chicken: ChickenThis Buffalo chicken dip starts with two cans of chunk chicken, making it extra easy and affordable. Of course, you can substitute rotisserie chicken or shredded chicken breasts if you'd prefer. Cream CheeseMake sure the cream cheese is softened for easy incorporation. Ranch DressingA cup of ranch dressing adds creaminess and tang. Hot SauceHot pepper sauce (such as Frank's) turns up the heat, mimicking the spicy flavor of Buffalo chicken wings. Use more or less than the recipe calls for to suit your flavor preferences. CheeseCheddar cheese is melted into the dip, creating a satisfyingly gooey texture and cheesy flavor. You'll be shocked how quickly and easily this Buffalo chicken dip comes together. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect: Heat the chicken and hot sauce in a skillet until heated through, then mix in the cream cheese and dressing. When the mixture is well-blended, add half of the cheese and stir until incorporated. Transfer the dip to a slow cooker. Sprinkle the remaining cheese on top and cook on Low until bubbly. Recipe creator NUNPUNCH suggests serving this Buffalo chicken dip with celery sticks and chicken-flavored crackers. Corn or tortilla chips would also work well.

603,Roasted Pumpkin Seeds,4.5,(850),621,5 mins,45 mins,50 mins,6,1 1/2 cups roasted pumpkin seeds,"If you're like us, you think the best thing about carving a pumpkin is saving the seeds for roasting! There are many different techniques for seasoning and roasting pumpkin seeds, but this simple method is trusted by hundreds of Allrecipes users. Learn how to prep pumpkin seeds for roasting, plus get ideas for seasoning or sweetening them. The most laborious part of roasting pumpkin seeds is prepping them. You first have to separate the seeds from the gooey mess inside of the pumpkin. Fortunately, we've got a few tricks up our sleeves for making this process as painless as possible: 1. Scoop the seeds. First, use a strong metal spoon to scoop as many of the seeds out of the pumpkin as you can. Be sure not to let the pulp dry before cleaning the seeds.2. Soak the seeds. Place the mass of seeds and pulp in a large bowl. Run water over them and use your hands to swish the seeds around, removing any noticeable bits of pumpkin. The flesh will separately more easily from the seeds this way. Drain off excess water.3. Rinse the seeds. Place the clean seeds in a colander and rinse until any remaining flesh is gone.4. Optional: Boil the seeds. Simmer the clean seeds in salty water for 10 minutes. (See below for why you should do this).5. Dry the seeds. Drain the boiled/cleaned seeds in a colander and use a towel to dry the seeds as thoroughly as possible to ensure they get nice and crispy when baked. Although you don't have to boil the pumpkin seeds before roasting, we recommend it. Boiling pumpkin seeds in salted water helps the salt to permeate the seeds inside the shells and helps them to cook more evenly. Once your seeds are prepped and ready to go, it's time to roast! You'll find ingredient measurements below, but here are the basic steps: Start by preheating the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Toss clean, dry seeds in a mixture of melted butter (or oil), salt, and any other seasonings of your choice. Spread the seeds in a single layer on a baking sheet. Be sure the seeds aren't overlapping so they turn out as crispy as possible. Tip: For less mess, line the baking sheet with parchment paper. Bake for about 45 minutes, or until golden brown. Check on your seeds every 10 minutes, removing the baking sheet, stirring, and spreading them out again. ​​Tip: You can roast the seeds of any winter squash, not just pumpkin. Allow the seeds to cool completely before storing. Roasted pumpkin seeds can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to two weeks or in the fridge for up to two months. This simple recipe allows for countless flavor combinations, both sweet and savory. Here are just a few favorite ingredients you can use to season and sweeten pumpkin seeds: Savory: chili powder, garlic salt, paprika, Worcestershire sauce, cumin, cayenne pepper, ranch dressing mix, Tajin, curry powder Sweet: maple syrup, honey, pumpkin pie spice, brown sugar, cinnamon Pumpkin seeds can be used for more than just snacking straight out of the bag (although, we do recommend that, too). Try mixing them into homemade granola, using them as a garnish for squash soup, adding them to trail mix, sprinkling them over baked goods, folding them into hummus, or using them as a salad topper. ""I learned from others that it is VERY important to keep your single layer single in order to get the nice toasty seeds…"" says reviewer JBANDK9S. ""My kids loved them — they want to buy another pumpkin just for the seeds!"" says one Allrecipes Member.

604,Balsamic Bruschetta,4.8,"(1,175)",790,15 mins,5 mins,20 mins,8,8 bruschetta,"When summertime gives you perfectly ripe and juicy tomatoes, one of the best ways to enjoy them is also one of the easiest. Simply dice the tomatoes, season them with a touch of salt, add a generous amount of good quality olive oil, and spoon the mixture over thick slices of toasted or grilled bread. Congratulations – you've just made bruschetta. This 5-star recipe for Balsamic Bruschetta shows you how to bump up that basic tomato mixture with basil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, and Parmesan cheese; and how to toast the bread in the oven — a good alternative if you don't have a grill or the weather isn't grill-friendly. Bruschetta (pronouced brew-SKET-tah) is an Italian appetizer or antipasti that starts with a base of toasted or grilled bread. The bread is then served warm either with a topping spooned over or with a topping on the side so each person can build their own bruschetta. Bruschetta is meant to be served as a hand-held finger food, large enough for one or two bites. You can top bruschetta with more than tomatoes, too. For example, try Strawberry Bruschetta and Peach Brulée Burrata Bruschetta for dessert-like versions. Read more: How to Make Bruschetta The best bread for bruschetta has a sturdy crust and is firm enough to hold the bruschetta topping. Choose a loaf of Italian bread, such as ciabatta, for a more traditional bruschetta. This recipe uses slices of French bread, like a baguette, but a rustic Italian bread is more authentic. Slice the bread on the diagonal at least ¼-inch thick or more to make an oval shape. Toasting the bread creates a sturdier surface that won't get mushy when you add a juicy, flavorful topping. Quality countsThe beauty of a simple recipe like bruschetta is that it showcases the flavor of the individual ingredients. For this recipe, you can really taste the difference when you use ripe tomatoes and fresh (not dried) basil; the best olive oil and balsamic vinegar you can afford, and hand-grated Parmesan cheese instead of pre-packaged grated cheese. Garlic optionsAs an alternative to adding minced raw garlic to the tomato mixture, cut a peeled clove of garlic in half lengthwise and lightly rub the cut side over the slightly roughened surface of the toasted bread to impart a hint of garlic flavor. Rub on a little more garlic for a stronger flavor, if you wish. But watch out: A little garlic goes a long way. Make-aheadMake the tomato mixture and let it sit for a couple of hours so the flavors can develop more complexity. Yes, the tomatoes may give off a lot of juice as they marinate, but if you think the mixture is too juicy come serving time, simply use a slotted spoon to lift out the bruschetta topping as you spoon it over the bread. Don't toss the liquid, though — lots of people love to dip into it with extra bread. If you're going to top the bread first before serving, save that step until the last minute so the bread doesn't get soggy as it sits.

606,Baked Kale Chips,4.5,"(2,628)","1,994",10 mins,20 mins,30 mins,6,6 servings,"Imagine being able to munch as many crunchy snacks as you want while you're binging that show you love without feeling guilty later. That's the beauty of these homemade baked kale chips. Made by quickly tossing together three simple ingredients – fresh kale, olive oil, and flaked sea salt – and baked low and slow for only 20 minutes, these crispy kale chips are easy to make, there are no mystery additives, and even fussy eaters snap them up. As easy as kale chips are to make, there are still a couple of tips to keep in mind for best results: Dry leaves completelyThe key to crispy kale chips is to make sure you thoroughly dry your kale leaves. Use paper towels or a dry dish towel to remove any drops of water that might remain after washing and spinning your kale. Damp leaves make soggy kale chips. Don't overdo the oilUse a light hand when you coat the dry kale leaves with olive oil. You don't want to drench them or they'll never crisp up. Spread outUse a large enough rimmed baking sheet so each kale leaf can lie flat in a single layer. Leaves that are bunched up or folded over won't crisp evenly. Bake in batches if you need to. Don't overbakeWhen it comes to baked kale chips, brown equals bitter. That's why it can be a little tricky to know when your kale chips are fully baked because you can't really judge by the color. You want to remove baked kale chips from the oven before they brown but while they're still a bit soft in the center. But don't worry; they will continue to crisp up after you take them out of the oven and let cool. For perfectly crispy baked kale chips, you might have to do a little trial and error to find the right balance. Any variety of kale – curly or flat – can be made into baked kale chips. Some home cooks prefer to use flat lacinato kale, aka ""dinosaur"" kale, so named for its leathery appearance, and some like the frilly appearance of curly kale. Try batches of both and see which you like best. If you don't eat them all in one go, you'll want to store baked kale chips the right way so they stay crisp and don't get mushy. Here's how to store homemade baked kale chips: Let them coolBaked kale chips fresh from the oven still give off enough moisture to make baked kale chips soggy. Let them cool completely before storing them. Airtight is just rightMost baked kale chip recipes that are flavored with salt or other dry seasonings can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week, although it's best to eat them within two or three days. Baked kale chips seasoned with something perishable like cheese should be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Once you master the basics of making baked kale chips, you can explore other flavorings. Try spicy Sriracha-Lime Kale Chips, tangy Salt and Vinegar Kale Chips, and sweet Maple Kale Crisps. ""Followed the advice of another reviewer and turned the oven down to 300 degrees F and cooked for 20 minutes, then turned oven off and let it sit for another 10 min.

610,Southern Pimento Cheese,4.8,"(1,000)",805,15 mins,,15 mins,12,3 cups,"Pimento cheese is the perfect dish to bring to potlucks, tailgates, and just about any get-together! The easy-to-make Southern staple is a true crowd-pleaser. This Southern pimento cheese recipe will surely become a go-to in your recipe box. Pimento cheese is a popular Southern spread that's traditionally made with shredded Cheddar, mayonnaise, and pimentos. It's commonly served with crackers and vegetables or as a sandwich filling. Pimento cheese is often called the ""pâté of the south."" You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics: These are the ingredients you'll need to make pimento cheese at home: · Cheese: This recipe calls for shredded extra-sharp Cheddar cheese. You can use a mix of mild and sharp Cheddar, if you'd like.· Mayonnaise: Mayonnaise is a key ingredient in traditional pimento cheese.· Cream cheese: Cream cheese makes this pimento cheese spread extra decadent.· Pimentos: Of course, you'll need jarred pimentos!· Jalapeños: A minced jalapeño is optional, but it's great for fans of spicy flavor.· Spices and seasonings: This pimento cheese is flavored with garlic powder, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper. It couldn't be easier to make homemade pimento cheese: Just mix all the ingredients until they're well-combined. Find the full, step-by-step recipe below. Tip: You can combine the ingredients in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment; beat until smooth and creamy. ""Pimento cheese is a Southern staple,"" says culinary producer Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. NicoleMcMom). ""If you've never had it, today is the day!"" Here are a few of her best pimento cheese tips and tricks: · Make sure to grate your own cheese from the block. ""Do not buy that pre-shredded stuff, it is not going to be the same,"" warns Nicole.· Using a stand mixer with the paddle attachment is a great shortcut for making big batches of pimento cheese, according to Nicole. But don't mix until the pimentos are pulverized! Stop when the mixture is well-combined.· Instead of pre-diced pimentos, Nicole likes to buy jarred and sliced pimentos to dice herself before adding them to the cheese mixture. Store the pimento cheese in a shallow, airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week. You can freeze pimento cheese for up to three months. Though it will still taste delicious, the flavor might be slightly different after it has been frozen and thawed. ""Delicious as-is,"" according to one Allrecipes community member.

614,Pico de Gallo,4.7,(596),400,20 mins,,20 mins,12,3 cups,"Everyone loves vibrant pico de gallo made with fresh, seasonal ingredients. Believe it or not, you can make restaurant-worthy pico de gallo in the comfort of your own home with this top-rated recipe. Loosely translated, pico de gallo means ""beak of a rooster."" Why? Nobody's quite sure. Some people speculate that the name comes from the way it was originally eaten (with the hands, by pinching the thumb and forefinger). Pico de gallo is a type of salsa, but it's probably different from the kind you get at your local Mexican restaurant. It contains less liquid than traditional salsa, it uses only fresh ingredients (some salsas are cooked on the stove), and pico de gallo is never blended (salsas can vary from pureed to gently mashed, but pico de gallo is always made with diced and chopped ingredients). The key to the perfect homemade pico de gallo? Use only the freshest ingredients you can find. Here's what you'll need: TomatoesRoma (plum) tomatoes are perfect for pico de gallo because they're less watery than other varieties. Choose ripe, red tomatoes that are firm and plump. OnionThis recipe calls for red onions instead of the traditional white onions, so it packs a flavorful punch. Of course, you can use whichever onions you prefer. CilantroFresh cilantro adds fresh flavor and vibrant green color. If you don't like cilantro, you can leave it out or substitute with parsley. JalapeñoTurn up the heat with fresh jalapeño. If you want to go the more traditional route, try serrano peppers instead. LimeLime juice lends fruity flavor. It also keeps the pico de gallo tasting and looking fresh for longer. GarlicThis recipe calls for both fresh and powdered garlic. The result? A powerfully garlicky pico de gallo. CuminA pinch of cumin adds warmth, nuttiness, and just a touch of sweetness to this pico de gallo recipe. Salt and PepperSalt and pepper enhance the other flavors and are the perfect finishing touch. It can be! The beauty of pico de gallo is you can customize the ingredients to suit your taste. If you like it hot, use more spicy peppers and leave in some seeds. If you don't, forgo the peppers — you can simply leave them out or replace them with an ingredient you prefer, such as green bell peppers, black beans, or corn. Homemade pico de gallo is best served fresh, so plan to enjoy it on the day you make it. If you need to keep it a little longer, you can store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to three days. There are plenty of ways to use pico de gallo: Serve it with tortilla chips, use it as a taco topping, use it as an ingredient in quesadillas or burritos, or mix it into scrambled eggs or Spanish rice. ""Simply awesome,"" according to Amber Nevland. ""I left this in the fridge for approximately 1 hour after mixing. Excellent flavor and aroma!"" ""I made this today and it is terrific,"" raves Jenn. ""This will be a go-to at our house from now on. I doubled the onion and garlic based on other reviews and it was perfect for us...we tend to like a lot of both of those. I was worried about the jalapeño, but it wasn't spicy, just flavorful."" ""We love this recipe,"" says Charlyn Spiering.

619,Traditional Filipino Lumpia,4.8,(506),405,40 mins,25 mins,1 hrs 10 mins,15,30 lumpia,"Did you know you can make restaurant-worthy lumpia in your own home? This lumpia produces perfectly crispy and absolutely irresistible spring rolls every time. Lumpia are fried spring rolls that are found in Filipino and Indonesian cuisines. The rolls traditionally feature a thin pastry skin (a.k.a. a lumpia wrapper) and are often stuffed with a savory mixture of ground pork and vegetables. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect: 1. Make the filling: Cook the pork until crumbly and set aside. Drain most (but not all) of the grease. Cook the onion and garlic in the remaining grease. Return the pork to the pan and stir in the veggies, cilantro, and seasonings. Remove from heat and let cool.2. Assemble the lumpia: Place three tablespoons of the filling on the wrapper and follow the instructions to roll and seal the lumpia. Repeat until all the rolls are assembled.3. Fry the lumpia: Heat oil in a skillet. Fry the lumpia three to four rolls at a time. Turn until all sides are brown. Drain on a paper towel. Lumpia is often served with a sweet chili dipping sauce (this 5-ingredient Hot and Sweet Dipping Sauce is an excellent choice). If you're sensitive to heat, you could try with a classic Sweet and Sour Sauce. Make it a meal by pairing your lumpia with Garlic Fried Rice or serving it as an appetizer for a traditional Filipino main dish, such as Caldereta. Allow the rolls to cool, then transfer the leftovers to an airtight container or wrap them tightly in foil. Store the lumpia in the refrigerator for up to four days. Yes, but it's best to freeze the lumpia before you fry it. To freeze un-fried lumpia: Arrange the cooled rolls on a baking sheet, then cover with storage wrap. Freeze for a few hours or up to overnight. When the lumpia are frozen solid, transfer the rolls to a zip-top freezer bag (don't forget to squeeze out the excess air) or another freezer-safe container. Wrap in foil for added protection. Lumpia can be frozen for up to three months. There's no need to thaw — just go ahead and fry the lumpia from frozen.

623,Best Egg Rolls,4.4,(693),549,25 mins,15 mins,40 mins,8,8 egg rolls,"It's easier than you think to make restaurant-worthy egg rolls in the comfort of your own kitchen. With this top-rated recipe, you'll learn how to make perfect egg rolls (and how to roll egg rolls) in less than half an hour. An egg roll is a fried appetizer that's found on countless Chinese-American restaurant menus. It consists of a thick, crispy wheat flour skin filled with shredded cabbage, pork, and other ingredients. Egg rolls are fried in hot oil, served warm, and usually dipped in duck sauce or soy sauce. Contrary to popular belief, egg rolls don't contain any eggs. So where does the name come from? Nobody quite knows, but there are a couple of theories. One legend holds that the popular appetizer is a twist on a dish called Dan Gun, which consists of ingredients (such as ham, sprouts, and mushrooms) wrapped in a thin omelet. Since omelets are made of eggs, the newer dish was called an ""egg roll."" This egg roll recipe calls for a ginger- and garlic-packed filling of pork, cabbage, and carrots. The filling is stuffed in a store-bought egg roll wrapper, which is sealed with a flour paste and fried to crispy perfection in hot peanut oil. Egg rolls and spring rolls are both cylindrical appetizers associated with Chinese cuisines, but there are few notable differences. Spring rolls are wrapped in thin flour or rice wrappers before being baked, fried, or left uncooked. Egg rolls, meanwhile, are wrapped in a thick wrapper that is then deep-fried. Spring rolls, which have ancient Chinese origins, are usually stuffed with seasonal vegetables and sometimes chicken or shrimp. Egg rolls, which were likely invented in the U.S, are often filled with pork and veggies. The egg roll is an ancestor of the spring roll. You'll find the full recipe below (including step-by-step instructions for how to roll egg rolls), but here's a brief overview of what can you can expect: Cook seasoned ground pork until brown and crumbly. Mix cooked pork, cabbage, and carrots in a large bowl. Meanwhile, mix flour and water in a small bowl. Lay one egg roll wrapper on a clean work surface. Place a scoop of the filling in the center of the wrapper and roll. Fold tightly and seal with flour paste. Fry the egg rolls until they're golden-brown and crispy. Drain on wire racks and/or paper towels. Sprinkle the finished egg rolls with sesame seeds (if you have them) and serve with your dipping sauce of choice.

You can typically find egg roll wrappers in the international food aisle, the produce section, or the deli section of the grocery store. If your local grocery store doesn't have egg roll wrappers, you may have to check the nearest Asian market or order them online. ""Best egg rolls ever,"" raves jen.

634,Doc's Best Beef Jerky,4.7,(433),357,20 mins,4 hrs,12 hrs 20 mins,10,,"If you like store-bought jerky, you'll absolutely love this homemade beef jerky. It's the best on the internet, if we do say so ourselves! All you'll need is some round steak, our irresistible beef jerky marinade, and a dehydrator to make this top-rated recipe. Beef jerky is lean, trimmed beef that has been cut into strips and dried. Drying (or dehydrating) meat with heat and salt slows bacterial growth dramatically, stretching its lifespan by many months. The word ""jerky"" comes from a Quechua word: ""Ch'arki,"" which literally means ""dry, salted meat."" This beef jerky is made from steak cut into thin strips and marinated in a sweet-savory marinade made with spices, sauces, and seasonings that you probably already have on hand. Some beef jerky recipes can be made in the oven, but this one requires a food dehydrator. What makes this beef jerky marinade so absolutely irresistible? The combination of sweet, savory, and umami-rich ingredients. This marinade is a beautiful blend of soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, liquid smoke, brown sugar, salt, pepper, meat tenderizer, garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika. Truly, it couldn't be easier to make this beef jerky. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect: Arrange beef strips in a single layer in a glass baking dish. In a bowl, mix together all of the marinade ingredients until they're well-combined. Pour the marinade over the beef, cover, and place in the fridge for 8 hours or up to overnight. Remove the strips from the marinade and place them between two sheets of plastic wrap. Pound the beef to 1/8-inch thickness with a meat mallet. Dry the beef in a dehydrator set to the highest setting for about 4 hours, or until the jerky is done to your liking. Avoid anything with a high fat content — the more fat there is, the harder it'll be to achieve the dry and chewy texture you're after. Plus, fatty cuts will cause the jerky to spoil more quickly. Choose a fresh, lean cut instead. This recipe calls for round steak. You could use sirloin or flank steak, but they'll be a bit pricier. Homemade beef jerky doesn't last quite as long as commercial beef jerky. We recommend enjoying this jerky within three months for the best texture and flavor. Store your homemade jerky in an airtight container in a cool, dry place for up to a month. Move it to the fridge to extend the shelf life by a couple more months. If you invest in a vacuum sealer, you could make your beef jerky last for up to a year. ""We raise cattle, and I routinely use a dehydrator to make jerky from our freezer full of fresh beef,"" says Wendy James Ashworth. ""Today I made this recipe as well as my family's reigning favorite jerky recipe. In a side-by-side taste test, this recipe was declared (5-0 votes) as the new favorite!"" ""You might as well double this recipe to start with,"" advises cheri. ""This is by far the best basic jerky recipe out there.

Instead, next time you want your Buffalo wing fix, try this top-rated recipe. Grab your favorite dipping sauce and celery sticks because this is about to be your new go-to hot wings recipe. You'll never be disappointed by dry or not-hot-enough wings ever again! You'll find the full step-by-step instructions below, but here's what you can expect from this hot wings recipe: 1. Coat with flour: Coat the chicken wings with a mixture of flour, paprika, cayenne pepper, and salt. Refrigerate coated wings for at least an hour.2. Make the sauce: In a saucepan on the stove, combine butter, hot sauce, pepper, and garlic. Stir until butter is melted, then remove from heat and reserve for later.3. Fry the wings: Fry the chicken wings in a skillet filled with oil heated to 375 degrees F. Remove the wings and place them on a paper-towel lined plate to remove the excess oil.4. Coat the wings: Drizzle the hot wings sauce over the fried wings or place the hot wings in a bowl with the sauce and mix together until combined. ""There ain't no thing like a chicken wing,"" according to culinary expert Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. NicoleMcMom). ""And there's no reason you should be making them at home."" We couldn't have said it better ourselves. Here are a few of Nicole's top hot wing tips and tricks: · The most budget-friendly way to make hot wings is to purchase whole chicken wings, then break them down into drumettes and flats yourself. Of course, you can buy them pre-cut if you're short on time or patience.· You can keep the sauce simple or make it your own with additional ingredients. Throw in some extra vinegar if you like your wings tangy or some honey if you're craving something spicy-sweet, recommends Nicole.· Don't try to fry too many wings at once. If you crowd the oil, Nicole says, you run the risk of bringing the temperature down.· Make sure the fried wings are fully tossed — don't just drizzle the sauce over them. Nicole likes to make a double-batch of sauce so she can ensure each wing is fully coated. Buffalo wings are delicious served with a side of ranch or blue cheese and cooling veggies (like celery or carrots). You can also serve hot wings as an appetizer for pizza or alongside mac and cheese (bonus points if you mix the hot wing sauce into the mac and cheese). Store hot wings in an airtight container in the fridge for up to four days. For best results, reheat leftover hot wings in the oven or air fryer — this will ensure they stay crispy. Freeze your hot wings so you'll have easy appetizers or dinners on hand at all times. Place hot wings in an airtight container or zip-top freezer bag and freeze for up to three months. ""Great wings!

648,Perfect Pot Stickers,4.7,(103),79,25 mins,5 mins,1 hrs,6,32 pot stickers,"Whether served as an appetizer or full-blown main dish, pot stickers are always a winning choice. Packed with savory flavors, Chef John's pot stickers are a little different because they're fried, steamed, and fried again for a delightfully crispy bottom with a tender, juicy filling. Be sure to bookmark this irresistible recipe because you'll be making these homemade pot stickers again and again. Pot stickers are a type of dumpling that are believed to have originated in China. Pot stickers are typically filled with ground pork and cabbage, but they can be stuffed with other ingredients too. They're usually pan-fried and steamed to give a soft, tender texture to the filling and a crunchy texture to the dumpling dough. You'll find the fully involved recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect: Combine ground pork, green onions, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil, cayenne, and cabbage in a bowl. Mix until combined and refrigerate until chilled and ready to use. Slowly pour hot water over flour and kosher salt. Stir until a dough forms. Knead the dough until smooth and elastic. Wrap the dough ball in plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes. Divide the dough ball into four equal pieces (keep the other pieces covered while working). Roll the dough into a log and divide into six equal pieces. Roll each piece into a pot sticker wrapper. Repeat until all dough is used. Place a small amount of pork filling into the center of each wrapper. Wet the edges of the wrapper and fold the two sides together. Pinch the edges together. Tap the pot sticker on the work surface to flatten it, then add a slight curve so it can stand on its own. Combine rice vinegar and soy sauce in a bowl. Set aside until ready to serve. Pan-fry the pot stickers until golden brown. Add water and steam for three minutes. Uncover and continue to pan-fry until water has evaporated and the pot stickers are crunchy. We love Chef John's method for cooking pot stickers. For crunchy, yet tender pot stickers, first pan-fry them in oil until the bottoms are golden brown. Add water to the skillet and cover — steam the pot stickers for three minutes. Uncover and allow to pan-fry again until the water has evaporated and the bottom of the pot stickers are crunchy. Chef John's dipping sauce for pot stickers is super simple and delicious. Just combine soy sauce and rice vinegar in a bowl. To dress up the sauce, you can also add hot sauce, garlic, minced green onions, or ginger. Store leftover pot stickers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to four days. Reheat in the microwave until warmed through. If you want the crispy bottom, reheat in the microwave until warmed through, then pan-fry in oil until crispy. Uncooked pot stickers are freezer-friendly. Simply follow the recipe until the pot stickers are assembled, but don't cook them yet. Transfer the pot stickers to a baking sheet and flash freeze them for a few hours (or until they're frozen solid). Transfer the now-frozen pot stickers to a zip-top freezer bag and freeze for up to three months. When you're ready to eat, there's no need to thaw the pot stickers. Simply follow this recipe to cook them from frozen. However, you may need to add a few minutes of cook time to account for the frozen temperature. ""My 17 yr old daughter said: 'It was better than restaurant quality,' says Denise Perchall. ""I did use wonton wrappers from the grocery, instead of making my own dough. Even using the pre-made wrappers, it did take me a little longer to prepare....but so worth it with the final product."" ""Chef John nails it with this one, the video is great, very useful and helpful,"" according to Scott Jennings. ""The prep took a while, but I will definitely be making this again and I know I will get faster. It took me about 90 minutes from start to finish, and they lasted me and my family all of 90 seconds to devour.. so good, even the sauce was spot on!!"" ""Absolutely delicious.

658,Authentic Mexican Shrimp Cocktail (Coctel de Camarones estilo Mexicano),4.9,(214),179,45 mins,,1 hrs 45 mins,4,,"This tangy and refreshing Mexican shrimp cocktail recipe screams ""summertime"" with a mouthwatering blend of chopped tomatoes, jalapenos, clam juice, and hot pepper sauce. Learn to make this vibrant dish and dive into 5-star flavor. A deliciously succulent and spicy shrimp cocktail is an instant party starter. You'll find the full recipe below with step-by-step instructions, but here's what you can expect when you make this top-rated recipe: Start by combining lime juice and onion in a small bowl. Allow the mixture to sit for at least 10 minutes. Combine shrimp with all vegetables (except avocado), salt, and pepper in a separate bowl. Stir tomato and clam juice, pepper sauce, ketchup, and cilantro into the shrimp mixture. Gently fold in avocados and onions before chilling for about one hour. Coctel de camarones is a garden-fresh dish that pairs well with salads and smoky meats alike. Try a zesty grilled corn recipe or spicy chorizo hash for perfectly balanced flavor. Shrimp cocktail is most delicious the same day it's made, but cooked shrimp will last 3-4 days in the refrigerator. Store in an airtight container or tightly wrapped in plastic for best results. To freeze Mexican shrimp cocktail, portion out small servings and place them in plastic bags. Place all of the bags in an airtight container to minimize exposure. Thaw shrimp in the refrigerator and reheat gently on the stovetop.

I'll show you how to make tasty chicken salad using this top-rated recipe for Basic Chicken Salad, and share plenty of tips and ideas along the way. This recipe for Basic Chicken Salad uses six simple ingredients and takes only 10 minutes to make from start to finish. After that, you can serve it up on salad greens, scoop it into pita bread or half an avocado, roll it up in a tortilla for a wrap, or serve it hot in a quesadilla or chicken melt. ChickenCooked chicken: chopped or shredded. If you have leftover roast chicken, grilled chicken, or rotisserie chicken, chicken salad is a great way to use it all up. You can also use canned chicken to make chicken salad (drain it first), or you can cook chicken for chicken salad. Use white or dark meat, or a combination of both if you prefer. MayonnaiseCreamy mayonnaise binds together all the separate ingredients for chicken salad into a satisfying mixture of flavors and textures. Use your choice of regular or reduced fat mayonnaise. In this chicken salad recipe, the mayonnaise is enhanced with a tablespoon of lemon juice for brightness and a ¼ teaspoon of ground black pepper. Taste the dressing before mixing it with the chicken; you may find it needs a little salt or other flavor-booster from your spice collection.

Store chicken salad in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Stored properly, chicken salad should last for three to five days.

Plus, I'll share tips for storing and freezing potato salad. (Yes, you can freeze potato salad!) More: The Best Potato Salads From Around the World Most of the work that goes into making this potato salad recipe is preparing the ingredients. After that, you simply combine them gently in a large bowl, cover, and chill to let the flavors develop. The best potato salads are a balance of flavors and textures, where creamy, tangy, sweet, salty, tender, and crunchy meet in perfect harmony. Here are the ingredients for this top-rated potato salad recipe: PotatoesIt's not potato salad without potatoes. The recipe doesn't specify what size potatoes or what kind, so choose medium-size potatoes, or enough to serve eight. As far as what kind of potatoes to use for potato salad, I'll cover that in the next section. EggsHard-boiled eggs are a must-have for this kind of old-fashioned potato salad, but you can leave them out if you really want to. CeleryCelery adds a crunchy element to balance the softer texture and creaminess of the potatoes. OnionYou can use any onion you like, including yellow, white, or red onions. Chop the onion into small, uniform pieces so no one bites into a big chunk of raw onion. RelishUse your favorite sweet pickle relish. Some reviewers chopped up sweet gherkin pickles, or substitute relish or pickles that are less sweet. MayonnaiseThis is the creamy element that brings all the ingredients together. For best results, mix the mayonnaise, mustard, relish, and seasonings together in a separate bowl. Give it a taste test and adjust the seasonings before adding to the potatoes, eggs, and onion. MustardUse your favorite mustard. Some reviewers like to use yellow mustard and some prefer Dijon. SeasoningsThis recipe calls for garlic salt, celery salt, and ground black pepper to taste; some reviewers added extras like paprika and garlic powder. You can add minced herbs, too, like dill, chives, parsley, and tarragon. More: Our Best Creamy Potato Salads The kind of potatoes you use will affect the texture of your potato salad. The recipe does not specify what kind of potatoes to use, but here are some guidelines to help you choose the best potatoes for potato salad so you get the results you're looking for. Waxy potatoes, like red potatoes and fingerling potatoes, have a smooth texture and will hold their shape even after boiling. And with their thin, delicate skins, they might not even need peeling. Use waxy potatoes if you like firm potatoes in your potato salad. Starchy potatoes, like Idahos or Russets, break down when they're boiled but their starchy texture soaks up dressing beautifully. Use starchy potatoes if you like softer creamier potatoes in your potato salad, but you'll have to peel them because of their thicker skins. All-purpose potatoes, like Yukon Golds, hit the sweet spot between waxy and starchy potatoes, and are reliable choices for potato salad. This recipe for Old-Fashioned Potato Salad instructs you to boil unpeeled potatoes in salted water until they're tender but still firm. You'll drain them and let them cool a bit, then peel and chop into bite-sized pieces. (Boiling helps the potato skins slip off easily.) Depending on how large your potatoes are, boiling could take between 10 to 15 minutes or more. Start testing for doneness at about 10 minutes by piecing a potato with a sharp paring knife. If it slides in easily all the way to the center of the potato, the potato is cooked and ready to drain. Flavor-boosting tipPotatoes have a very mild flavor on their own; that's why you add salt to the boiling water. To add even more flavor to the boiled potatoes, lay them out on a rimmed baking sheet after peeling and chopping, and while they're still warm. Sprinkle them with a little vinegar, salt, and pepper. Let the potatoes cool until they're not steaming anymore, then proceed with the rest of the recipe. More: How to Make the Best Potato Salad Potato salad should be covered and stored in the refrigerator. Do not let potato salad sit at room temperature for more than two hours, or even less on a warm day. If you're serving potato salad at a picnic or BBQ, place the serving bowl in a bed of ice to keep it very cool. Properly wrapped and chilled, potato salad will last in the refrigerator for three or four days. Yes, you can freeze potato salad. For best results, cool it completely then spoon it into an airtight freezer bag and lay it flat. Squeeze out as much air as you can without crushing the potato salad. If you have a lot of potato salad to freeze, use two or more bags. Thinner layers are best both for freezing and thawing. Properly frozen potato salad will last in the freezer for up to three months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight. You might have to add a little more dressing before serving potato salad that has been frozen and thawed. ""We love this recipe, says Allrecipes home cook cakesnthings. ""I have made it several times. The only thing that I do differently is use sweet pickles chopped up instead of using sweet relish.

676,"Marinated Cucumber, Onion, and Tomato Salad",4.7,(659),516,15 mins,,2 hrs 15 mins,6,6 servings,"There's a lot to love about this top-rated cucumber tomato salad recipe. It's inexpensive to make using everyday ingredients, it's a crisp and refreshing side dish that goes with just about anything, and it has make-ahead convenience built right in. Let's dive into this dish and see why Allrecipes home cooks award it a solid 5-stars. This recipe for Marinated Cucumber, Onion, and Tomato Salad has most of the ingredients right there in the title. Cool, crisp cucumbers and juicy ripe tomatoes are teamed up with onions in a satisfying mix of flavor and texture. But what pulls this dish together is the tart and tangy salad dressing made of water, vinegar, oil, sugar, salt, and pepper. It takes only 15 minutes to prep the salad itself: Whisk the ingredients for the dressing, peel and slice the cucumbers, cut the tomatoes into wedges, slice the onion into rings, and place everything together in a bowl. After that, it goes into the refrigerator to marinate for at least two hours so the dressing can work its magic to enhance and balance all the flavors. That marination step means you can make this salad well ahead of time and stash it in the fridge until you're ready to dish it up. CucumbersChoose firm cucumbers with smooth, firm skins and no soft spots. Cucumbers lose water quickly after they're picked and will start to show shrinking and wrinkling if they've been in storage for too long. TomatoesThis recipe doesn't specify what kind of tomatoes to use, but you'll want to choose the ripest, tastiest tomatoes you can find. Heirloom tomatoes have the best flavor, but unless you grow them yourself, they can be pricier than the everyday tomatoes from your supermarket. You can use cherry tomatoes or Roma tomatoes, too. Whichever tomato variety you choose, get the best you can afford because the flavor of the tomatoes play a starring role. If you do use smaller tomatoes, be sure to slice them so the marinade can soak in and do its work. Read more: How to Pick the Best Tomatoes OnionsYou can use any onion you like for this recipe: yellow, white, or red. Each brings a different flavor profile to the mix. Yellow onions are inexpensive, easy to find, and have a predictable onion flavor. White onions are a bit sweeter and milder than yellow onions. Red onions are a little spicier than yellow onions, and carry their bright color through to the salad. Sweet onions are pricier, and as the name suggests, their flavor is milder and naturally sweeter. Read more: What's the Difference Between White, Yellow, and Red Onions? VinegarThe recipe lists distilled white vinegar, but here again you can substitute other vinegars to suit your taste. Some Allrecipes home cooks who made this recipe used white wine vinegar, apple cider vinegar, Champagne vinegar, rice wine vinegar, and white balsamic vinegar. Read more: The Difference Between the Six Most Popular Types of Vinegar OilVegetable oil is called out in this recipe, and it's a good choice because of its neutral flavor. But you can also use good quality olive oil if you prefer, as some reviewers did. Properly covered and chilled, cucumber tomato salad will last 3-5 days in the refrigerator. The cucumbers might lose a little crispness after a couple of days depending on their freshness when you used them and how thickly you sliced them. The onions will continue to mellow and take up the sweet and tart flavors of the dressing. The tomatoes should still be juicy and flavorful, although their structure may break down a bit as they soak. The real question is, what doesn't go with cucumber tomato salad? This crisp, light, sweet, tart, crunchy, juicy salad is a perfect side dish for everything from grilled foods and fried foods to saucy BBQ dishes and everyday picnic sandwiches. Cucumber tomato salad provides a snappy contrast to creamy potato, macaroni, or pasta salads, and can hold its own in any potluck buffet. ""Super easy recipe. Love it,"" says Allrecipes home cook Bethany Idontwanttouseit. ""Followed advice of some others and made with apple cider vinegar. Delicious. Also used a sweet onion since it didn't specify. I found that the longer it marinated, the better it was."" Reviewer Jimdchimp9 says, ""Big hit this summer! Made it a couple times. Second time I used a little less water but it is great. I made it again today for a church get together and was asked by a few people for this recipe."" ""Just made this and WOW! Love it. Wo delicious. I used Vidalia onion and cherry tomatoes.

720,Microwave Baked Potato,4.2,(389),309,1 mins,11 mins,12 mins,1,1 serving,"When you're short on time or patience, waiting an hour or more for an oven-baked potato might seem like a tall order. That's why this recipe is so darn good – you can have a perfectly microwaved baked potato in just a little more than 10 minutes! It sounds too good to be true but, we promise, this recipe is just as good as reviewers say it is. It couldn't be easier to microwave baked potatoes. You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect: Scrub your potato under running water, prick it with a fork, then place it on a microwave-safe plate. Microwave for about 5 minutes, flip it over, and microwave it for about 5 more minutes. Let the potato cool for just a few minutes, until it's safe to handle. Cut the potato lengthwise so that it opens and forms a natural bowl. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, then mash the inside with a fork. Top with butter and Cheddar, then return to the microwave to melt the cheese. Finish it with sour cream and the toppings of your choice. We find that this 10-minute method works well to create a perfectly tender baked potato – 5 minutes on one side, 5 minutes on the other. However, not all microwaves cook at exactly the same power. If you've found in the past that your microwave is more or less powerful than other microwaves, you may want to adjust the recipe by a few minutes. This microwave baked potato recipe calls for a russet potato, and we think that's the best way to go. Russets have thick skin that crisps up nicely in the microwave or in the oven. Plus, they have super starchy insides that'll ensure a perfectly fluffy filling. Technically, though, you can use any starchy potato you have on hand. Classic baked potato toppings include sour cream, Cheddar, crumbled bacon, and fresh chives. You can get as creative as you want, though! Try chili and shredded cheese for a fun take on a classic comfort food, cooked pulled pork and barbecue sauce to satisfy a barbecue craving, or pico de gallo and black beans for a Mexican-inspired option. You can eat these microwave baked potatoes as a meal by themselves. Just dress it up with toppings and you're good to go (throw in a Caesar salad or roasted veggies to add a little color to your plate). However, many people like to serve baked potatoes as a side dish, paired with hearty meat-based entrees.

722,Quick Tartar Sauce,4.5,(283),235,5 mins,,5 mins,8,1 cup,"Tartar sauce is the perfect companion to seafood. With just four ingredients, this tartar sauce recipe comes together so quickly and easily. All you need is five minutes and you'll have a creamy and flavorful dipping sauce ready for any fish, oyster, or crab cake dish, or even veggies and pita bread. You might never need to buy another bottle of tartar sauce again. Tartar sauce is a cold dipping sauce that is usually served alongside seafood, mainly fish. It's a creamy condiment that is known for its rich and tangy flavor. Tartar sauce is a staple condiment at many seafood restaurants because it's mostly used for fried fish and fried oysters. But it can also be used as a dipping sauce for sandwiches and roasted veggies or as a salad dressing. Wondering what's in tartar sauce? It's typically made with mayonnaise, chopped pickles or relish, lemon juice, and herbs (like tarragon and dill). There are also a handful of optional ingredients you can add that take the tartar sauce's flavor to the next level. For example, this recipe includes yellow mustard. Other ingredients may include capers, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, olives, or onion. Making homemade tartar sauce is quite simple. All you have to do is mix all your ingredients together in a bowl — then your sauce is ready to go. You should refrigerate the sauce for at least 30 minutes before serving. The relish (or pickles, if that's what you're using) will make the sauce a little chunky, so you can puree your sauce in a food processor or blender for a smoother consistency. Tartar sauce's roots are difficult to track. It's believed that tartar sauce originated in France after the 18th century because France first invented mayonnaise, which is a main ingredient in tartar sauce. The name might just be an even bigger mystery. Many people think tartar sauce was named after the Tatars, who also may have lent their name to steak tartare. It's thought that the French based the sauce's name off their spelling of Tatar, which is tartare. That's why it's called sauce tartare in France, tartare sauce in the U.K. and other parts of the Commonwealth, and tartar sauce in the U.S. When stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator, homemade tartar sauce should stay fresh for up to two weeks. ""This was super easy! We ran out of store-bought stuff, so I made this quick. I didn't have relish, so I threw a couple forkfuls of hamburger pickles into the Ninja, added the mayo, mustard, and lemon juice to the chopped pickles, and it was perfect. I might never buy store-bought again,"" says Tracy Robinson. ""This was, without a doubt, the easiest and most tasty tartar sauce I've had- period. The base flavor is great because it isn't just a bland mayo with sweet pickles, it actually has mustard to spice it up. I can't say enough good about it except to mention that it keeps amazingly well too,"" raves Mina Y. ""It is definitely quick, and very tasty. I always have these ingredients on hand, so I will use this recipe again and again! If you prefer your tartar sauce with a dill flavor, just use dill relish instead of sweet,"" according to Pam Ziegler Lutz.

723,Gourmet Mushroom Risotto,4.8,"(3,464)","2,413",20 mins,25 mins,45 mins,6,6 servings,"Risotto ranks right up there as one of the greatest dishes you can make with rice. Originating in Italy, risotto is a recipe made by simmering a starchy variety of rice in broth, with flavor-boosting ingredients added like onions, garlic, vegetables, meats, spices, herbs, and cheese. This 5-star recipe for mushroom risotto has thousands of ratings and reviews, and is a top-rated favorite for our Allrecipes community of home cooks. There are all kinds of tasty add-ins to risotto, and mushrooms are just one of them. Mushrooms add an earthy, savory flavor to risotto that makes it a good complement to main dishes like roast chicken, pork, or beef. You can serve mushroom risotto as a side dish, a main dish, or a starter to a multi-course Italian menu. Chicken brothHomemade chicken broth is always the best choice for flavor, but you can use store-bought chicken broth for convenience. Choose low-sodium broth and adjust the seasonings at the end. Since you'll keep it hot on the stove while you're stirring it into the risotto, you can bump up the flavor of the broth by simmering it with scraps of shallots, chives, and mushroom stems left over from prepping the risotto ingredients. To make this vegetarian, substitute vegetable broth. Olive oilFor sautéing the mushrooms and shallots. You won't be cooking at high heat, so it's okay to use extra virgin olive oil. MushroomsThis recipe uses a combination of portobello and white mushrooms. See how to clean mushrooms. ShallotsIf you don't have shallots, you can substitute finely chopped yellow onion. Arborio riceTo get that signature creamy risotto texture, you must use a particular type of short-grain, high-starch rice like Arborio, Carnaroli, or Vialone Nano that releases its starch as you cook and stir. No other rice will give you the same results. White wineThe first liquid you add to the pan after you sauté the rice is a half cup of wine — it will absorb into every grain and create an essential layer of flavor. Choose wisely. Go for a crisp, dry white wine like pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc. If you don't want to use wine, just start with the broth. ButterA generous amount of butter at the end adds more creamy texture and rich flavor. Parmesan cheeseYou've come this far. Don't shortchange the flavor of your risotto by using anything other than freshly grated Parmesan cheese. ChivesChives cut through the richness and add visual appeal, too. If you don't have chives, fresh parsley is a good substitute. You'll find the measurements and step-by-step recipe directions below, but here are top tips to make the best mushroom risotto: Hot brothKeep the broth hot the whole way through. Measure out a little more into the broth pot than the recipe says to make up for evaporation as it sits. Toast the riceAn essential step to making risotto is to toast the grains in hot oil until they start to turn translucent around the edges. This could take a couple of minutes. Stir continuously during this process. StirYes, you stir risotto as it simmers. That's what helps release the starch from the grains of rice to make that creamy texture you want. Do you have to stir constantly? No. Stir after each half cup of broth you add to make sure the broth is distributed evenly, then stir again every 30 seconds or so until almost all the broth is absorbed. Add another half cup of broth and repeat. Listen to music. Sip some wine. Good risotto is worth the time it takes. TemperatureKeep the broth hot and the risotto at a low simmer throughout. TextureRisotto is done when the rice is al dente: firm but not crunchy when you bite into it. It should not be as dry as steamed rice, but should have enough liquid to make it loose. Add just a touch more broth if needed before stirring in the butter and Parmesan cheese. Serve immediatelyRisotto waits for no one. It will continue to cook as it sits even when it's off the heat, so be prepared to dish it up right away. Store leftover risotto in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to three days. You can reheat risotto, but it won't have the same creamy texture as freshly made risotto. Try forming leftover risotto into patties using an egg and fine breadcrumbs as a binder, and fry them in oil to make risotto cakes. You can freeze mushroom risotto in an airtight container for up to three month, but the texture won't be the same as freshly made. Use a freezer-safe zip-top bag with the air squeezed out of it. Thaw overnight in the fridge. ""Great! With the leftovers I make Risotto al Salto. I shape about a half cup of the cold risotto and pan-fry it with olive oil until it is golden brown.

The creamy, decadent, and oh-so satisfying recipe is sure to please everyone at your table. These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated au gratin potatoes recipe: · Potatoes: This recipe starts with thinly sliced Russet potatoes. You can substitute Yukon gold, if you like.· Onion: Slice one onion into rings to layer with the potatoes.· Seasonings: These creamy au gratin potatoes are simply seasoned with just salt and pepper.· Butter and flour: The cheese sauce starts with a roux made with butter and all-purpose flour.· Milk: Make sure you slowly whisk in the milk to create the creamiest consistency.· Cheese: Because isn't everything better with shredded Cheddar?

Au gratin potatoes and scalloped potatoes are both creamy, rich, and starchy side dishes. But they're not quite the same thing: Au gratin potatoes are usually sliced slightly thinner than their scalloped counterparts. Also, scalloped potatoes traditionally don't include cheese (but more modern recipes can incorporate cheese into the mix).

This homemade spaghetti sauce with ground beef recipe will satisfy all your comfort food cravings. Restaurant-worthy spaghetti sauce with ground beef is just a few steps away. You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect: Cook ground beef in a saucepan over medium-high heat with garlic, onion, and green pepper. Stir until the meat is brown and crumbly. The vegetables should be tender. Stir diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste into the beef mixture. Add oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer until thick and aromatic, then serve over cooked spaghetti noodles. If your spaghetti sauce didn't turn out exactly how you wanted it to, don't worry! There's probably an easy fix. This recipe should result in a perfectly thick spaghetti sauce. But things happen! If you somehow end up with a runny consistency, there are a few ways to thicken it. You could simmer the sauce for a few more minutes — this will reduce some of the liquid and leave you with a thicker sauce. For a quicker fix, make a slurry with one part water and one part cornstarch. Stir the slurry slowly into the sauce until you've reached the desired thickness. This top-rated recipe calls for garlic, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. However, you can certainly adjust, eliminate, or add seasonings to suit your taste. To make this spaghetti sauce your own, you could add parsley or spice things up with crushed red pepper. Just remember to taste the sauce every time you add an ingredient so you don't accidentally add too much or too little. We love the texture and flavor of this spaghetti sauce when it simmers for about an hour. If you'd like your sauce a little thinner, reduce the time a bit.

727,Candied Yams,4.5,(813),602,15 mins,25 mins,40 mins,6,6 servings,"Although there's no rule against making candied yams any time you want, there are three times a year when candied yam recipes reach their peak popularity: Thanksgiving by far leads the way, with Christmas and Easter coming in a distant second and third. So, it's safe to say that if you're making candied yams, it's probably for a holiday feast. And with all the prep and cooking that goes into the holidays, it's no surprise that our Allrecipes home cooks appreciate an easy four-ingredient recipe like Candied Yams as a no-fuss side dish to round out their special holiday menus. This top-rated recipe for candied yams requires only four ingredients: canned sweet potatoes, butter, brown sugar, and miniature marshmallows. The prep time is a mere 15 minutes (if that much) and the baking time is 25 minutes. That all adds up to about 40 minutes from start to finish. Drain the syrupThis is a key move so your candied yams don't turn out runny due to too much liquid in the baking dish. Place the drained yams into a medium baking dish. Dice the butterCut the cold butter into small pieces and distribute them evenly over the yams. Sprinkle the brown sugarMeasure the brown sugar by packing it firmly into the measuring cup. Then transfer it to a bowl to break it up and make it easier to sprinkle. This is a good opportunity to crush any lumps in the brown sugar. Cover with mini marshmallowsThis is where you might use more than the amount of marshmallows called for in the recipe, depending on how much surface area you're covering. You want them pretty close together so they'll make that signature toasted marshmallow topping that marshmallow-lovers love. Bake for 25 minutes at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)Because the yams are fully cooked already, what you're really doing is heating them up and toasting the marshmallows until they're golden and melty. This is one of those easy holiday casserole side dish recipes that you can toss together a day or two ahead of time (hold aside the marshmallows so they don't dissolve as they sit), cover, and keep in the fridge until you're ready to top with marshmallows and bake. Yams and sweet potatoes are not the same thing. What we call yams in the United States are actually sweet potatoes. Real yams are more akin to yucca, with dry and starchy flesh, and are usually hard to find in everyday grocery stores. Read the label on the canned yams called for in this recipe – it will most likely say something like ""sweet potatoes in syrup."" So when someone says ""yams,"" we know they're probably talking about sweet potatoes. Read more: What's the Difference Between Yams and Sweet Potatoes Use about three or four medium sweet potatoes for the 29-ounce can of yams called for in the recipe. Be sure to peel, cut, and cook the raw sweet potatoes before proceeding with the rest of the recipe. You can boil, microwave, or bake the sweet potatoes until tender but not mushy. Angela Oschefski says, ""Fantastic! I used fresh yams and just parboiled them instead of using canned but it was a super easy dish to make and delicious! I just served it for Thanksgiving this past weekend and everyone loved it!"" ""This is a fantastic basic recipe,"" says Lisa D. ""Wonderful to build upon based on individual tastes.

They take very little time to cook and, depending on the method, even less time to prep. This easy recipe for sautéed green beans is a perfect case in point. It preps in just 5 minutes, cooks in about 10 (depending on how crunchy you like your green beans), and is ready in 15 minutes. With hundreds of ratings and reviews, this green bean recipe is a favorite choice of our Allrecipes home cooks. A little butter, minced garlic, and lemon-pepper seasoning are all you need to bring the best out of fresh green beans. If you don't have lemon-pepper seasoning or simply prefer the flavor of fresh lemon, replace the lemon-pepper seasoning with a little freshly ground black pepper to taste along with the zest of one lemon and a couple teaspoons of lemon juice. You'll find the complete recipe below, with ingredients and step-by-step directions, but it all comes down to these easy steps: SimmerPlace trimmed green beans into a large skillet, cover with cold water, bring to a boil and simmer until they're just tender. For this green bean recipe, it's better to undercook slightly than overcook. Total cook time will depend on the size of your beans and how you like them. For crisp-tender beans, you will need less time. Drain the green beans and return them to the skillet. The residual heat will continue to cook the green beans. SautéAdd butter to the hot skillet and stir until melted. Add minced garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, making sure the green beans are coated with the garlicy butter. Season and serve. There are a few ways to trim green beans, from snapping off the ends to trimming them with a paring knife one by one. But many home cooks and chefs alike swear by a method that happens to be the easiest. Here's how to trim green beans fast: Step 1First, line up the green beans on your cutting board so the tips are all even. You can either keep them somewhat bunched up or spread them out. Step 2Next, using a chef's knife or paring knife, cut off the tips with just one slice. Step 3Flip the beans so the tips will be closer to the hand you cut with, and realign them if necessary. Once again, slice the green beans in a single motion. And just like that, you're done! If you want shorter green beans, you can line them up again and cut them to your desired length. For this buttery garlic green beans recipe, you'll just need to cut your trimmed green beans in half. So easy! ""This is one of my favorite ways to make green beans,"" says Sarah Jo. ""I like to add a little finely minced onion to the skillet along with the garlic. I usually double this recipe because my family inhales it.""

735,Buffalo Chicken Wing Sauce,4.8,(845),649,,5 mins,5 mins,8,8 servings,"Everyone needs a good Buffalo sauce recipe in their back pocket. Once you try Chef John's tried-and-true Buffalo sauce (inspired by the original recipe from Buffalo, New York), you'll never go back to the bottled stuff. Buffalo sauce and hot sauce are not the same thing. Hot sauce is a spicy blend of cayenne pepper, vinegar, and salt. Buffalo sauce, meanwhile, is hot sauce that's been enhanced with butter and other ingredients. Buffalo sauce is much richer and smoother than regular hot sauce. It's used as a dipping sauce or a condiment. Of course, Buffalo sauce is most commonly associated with chicken wings. So where does the name come from? It has nothing to do with bison. The spicy sauce was named after its birthplace: Buffalo, New York. Teressa Bellissimo, owner of Anchor Bar, invented Buffalo sauce in 1964. At the time, chicken wings were usually thrown out or used to make stock for soup. When Bellissimo's son asked her to prepare a late-night snack for his friends, she deep-fried the wings and tossed them in a buttery hot sauce. Thus, Buffalo wings (and Buffalo sauce) were born. It can be! Buffalo sauce is usually available in mild, medium, and hot options. When you make homemade Buffalo sauce, you have the ability to control the spiciness level — use more cayenne pepper if you like it hot or less if you prefer milder flavors. Homemade Buffalo sauce comes together surprisingly quickly with just a few ingredients. Here's what you'll need to make the best Buffalo sauce of your life: Hot SauceA hot, cayenne-pepper sauce (such as Frank's or Crystal) is the spicy base for this classic Buffalo sauce. ButterButter adds a velvety smooth richness. It also balances the flavors of the other ingredients. VinegarWhite vinegar lends welcome acidity and a pleasant tanginess. Worcestershire Sauce, Cayenne, and Garlic PowderWorcestershire sauce deepens the flavor, cayenne pepper turns up the heat, and garlic powder adds a powerful bite. Anyone can make restaurant-worthy Buffalo sauce at home. Seriously — it's as simple as combining all the ingredients in a pot, bringing it to a simmer, and whisking until the sauce is nice and thick. Find the full recipe below for detailed, step-by-step instructions that'll make the process a breeze. Store homemade Buffalo sauce in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. You may have to shake up or stir refrigerated Buffalo sauce, as the ingredients have a tendency to separate over time. ""This is a terrific sauce,"" according to Tim Anderson. ""You can mess around with the heat via the cayenne, but I like it as it is. The vinegar and butter really bring balance to it."" ""This sauce is perfect,"" according to Abby215. ""So easy to make and exactly what a wing sauce should be — the perfect blend of tangy and spicy. And, if you bake your wings, the butter really helps with the crispiness. Delicious — thanks Chef John!! ""You cannot go wrong with this wing sauce if you make sure to use Frank's as your base,"" says BARCHAM. ""It is easy to adjust the heat level by the amount of butter you add to the mix. I usually add some paprika for a bit of a flavor boost and sometimes a few drops of liquid smoke to finish things off.""

736,Easy Coleslaw Dressing,4.8,"(2,261)","1,846",5 mins,,5 mins,6,6 servings,"With minimal ingredients and prep work, this top-rated coleslaw dressing is your new summer potluck secret — but don't take it from us, take it from over 1,500 reviewers who gave it a five-star rating. You can shred your own cabbage and carrots or transform store-bought coleslaw mix into a refreshing and creamy side dish with this dressing. This creamy, mayo-based dressing uses ingredients you likely have on hand: sugar, lemon juice, vinegar, salt, pepper, and of course, mayonnaise. The resulting dressing is just the right balance of sweet, tangy, creamy, and peppery! For a creamy coleslaw, as opposed to vinegar-based, mayonnaise is essential. Use your favorite store brand or make your own! A sweetener is necessary to balance out the tang of the vinegar and the acidity of the lemon. This recipe calls for standard white sugar, but honey or maple syrup may also be used. Not all coleslaw dressing calls for lemon juice, but it helps to amp up the flavor and add some brightness. Vinegar is the primary source of coleslaw's signature tang. Use either apple cider vinegar or white vinegar. Bring it all home with a little salt and pepper! No need to get fancy with seasonings, the simplicity of this recipe is what makes it so good. This recipe makes enough dressing for a 14-ounce bag of coleslaw mix, or about 8 cups of shredded cabbage and carrots. Make the dressing up to a week in advance and refrigerate until you're ready to put it to use. When it comes time to serve, simply toss the coleslaw in the dressing. You can make your coleslaw dressing ahead of time so that it's at the ready anytime you want to make coleslaw. Refrigerate coleslaw dressing in an airtight container. For best results, use within one week. ""We ate it as a side as well as on a bun of BBQ pulled chicken. Really good both ways,"" says reviewer NettieO. ""I mixed it into a 14oz bag of coleslaw mix and it wasn't too runny or dry,"" says reviewer Sarah Flores. ""I was afraid it would be too peppery because I'm not a fan of pepper, but it was well balanced. On my 2nd helping, I sprinkled a little celery seed on top and I liked it even better."" ""I think the key was making dressing the day before and letting the flavors intensify overnight,"" says reviewer Kim.

745,Best Fried Green Tomatoes,4.7,"(1,034)",821,5 mins,15 mins,20 mins,4,4 servings,"Southern-style fried green tomatoes are the crisp, tangy, and boldly savory appetizer you should be making all year. This classic, down-home dish features sliced unripe tomatoes that are dredged in flour and cornmeal before being skillet-fried to buttery-brown perfection. Our community of home cooks loves the simple seasonings and wonderful crunch of this old-fashioned recipe. Learn how to make, store, and freeze the tastiest fried green tomatoes ever. Green tomatoes are unripe red tomatoes with much firmer flesh and a sharp, tart flavor. Most are intentionally picked before maturing to ensure the crispest, driest fruit possible. Because they have a lower water content, green tomatoes are perfectly suitable for sauteeing and frying. Your fried tomatoes will hold up best if you cut them horizontally in ¼- to ½-inch thick slices. If you like, you can sprinkle a tiny pinch of sugar on each slice to chase away any lingering bitterness. Before frying, dredge the tomato slices in seasoned flour — or make a thicker breading: dip the slices lightly in flour, then in beaten egg, followed by a substantial coating of breadcrumbs, cornmeal, or cracker crumbs. For real down-home flavor, fry them in bacon grease (or a mix of bacon grease and vegetable oil). Whatever kind of fat you use, make sure it's around 375 degrees F for crispy golden-brown results. Half the fun of eating fried green tomatoes is dipping them in a creamy and flavorful sauce. Serve this Southern dish with zippy remoulade, honey mustard, or a sweet chili sauce for an incredibly delicious finish. Whip up your sauce ahead of time so the flavors have time to meld as you prepare and cook the fried green tomatoes. Although fried green tomatoes are best enjoyed piping hot and perfectly crisp, you can store them in the refrigerator for one to two days. Keep them in an airtight container, and reheat in an oiled skillet, oven, or air fryer. After being cooked, fried green tomatoes are not great candidates for freezing. But sliced and battered green tomatoes can be stored safely in the freezer for up to a year. Simply pat tomatoes dry, dip them in egg wash, dredge in a flour-cornmeal mixture, then freeze. Use an airtight container or freezer bag to hold the battered tomatoes. You'll have zesty, Southern-style goodness ready to pop into the skillet year-round. Culinary producer Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. Nicole McMom) says these fried green tomatoes are perfectly crunchy on the outside, but tender and juicy on the inside. Here are a few of her best tips and tricks for making these ""summer delights:"" · Make the flour coating super thin for the crispiest tomatoes — you want to be able to see a hint of skin underneath.· Don't try to fry all the tomatoes at the same time. Just like with all fried foods, you don't want to crowd the pan. Cook the tomatoes in batches for the best results.· Before you start frying, line a baking sheet with paper towels and place a cooling rack on top. This will allow the fried green tomatoes to drain without becoming soggy.· Nicole loves serving her fried green tomatoes with a flavorful, creamy remoulade. Need a good recipe?

747,Crispy Hash Browns,4.5,"(1,176)",885,20 mins,15 mins,35 mins,4,4 servings,"If you're a firm believer that potatoes make basically any meal taste better, then you've come to the right place. Because we are too — especially when it comes to breakfast potatoes. Choosing which type of breakfast potato to make can be a tough decision, but if you're craving crispy potatoes that remind you of your favorite restaurant, then you should try this hash brown recipe. The shredded potatoes are formed into pancake-like hash browns and lightly pan-fried for the perfect crispy texture that will pair deliciously with any breakfast dish. Believe it or not, making crispy hash browns is actually quite easy. First, shred your potatoes using your preferred method — either with a grater, food processor, or mandoline. Rinse the potatoes until the water is clear, then drain and squeeze out all the remaining liquid (this will ensure the hash browns are extra crispy). Next, you'll add in your binding agents (flour and egg) as well as any other ingredients or seasonings. This recipe only calls for onion, but you could also add cheese, cayenne pepper, or garlic to the mixture. Form your hash browns into patties (either one large hash brown or multiple smaller pancake-like hash browns) and pan fry them in oil, about five minutes on each side. To keep your hash browns crispy, make sure to heat the oil to sizzling before adding the patties and wait until the one side is golden brown before flipping. You can also make your hash browns thinner because they will get crispier and cook more evenly. If you care about the crisp, then you should use starchy potatoes, like russets or Idahoes. The only drawback is that the hash browns may be prone to falling apart because of the starchiness. So, if you want your hash brown to stick together easily, then you should use a waxy potato, like new potatoes, Yukon Golds, or red potatoes. These potatoes have more moisture and will stick together in the pan, however, they won't crisp up as nicely as starchy potatoes. The biggest culprit that's making your hash browns come apart is moisture. You need to make sure the potatoes are dry before adding them to the flour and egg mixture. Whether you squeeze them out in a dish towel or use a salad spinner, get the potatoes as dry as they can be. You can also use a different type of potato if you are worried about the hash browns breaking apart. If you use a waxy potato, they'll stick together nicely, but they won't get as crispy as you might want. Another option is to add more ingredients that will act as binders. Try adding cheese to your hash browns because when the cheese melts it will be like a gooey glue that holds your potatoes together. ""These turned out great! They weren't greasy at all, they held together perfectly, and they looked quite pretty when they were done cooking, too. Next time, I think I will add salt & pepper, plus some extra spices, to the shredded potato and egg/flour mixture, just to give it a more intense flavor. This recipe is so easy that I will have no problems just making these hash browns from memory, eyeballing the flour and spices,"" says eiskyjente. ""Unbelievable. About as good as one could hope for. Crispy on the outside, firm and tasty on the inside. And what a flavor. This will be my hash brown recipe from here on out. Make sure that you don't have too much oil in the pan. The hash browns will take forever to brown and may be too greasy for your taste,"" advises Curt McLey. ""My first try at making hash browns. Success. I added sharp Cheddar, a little garlic powder, a dash of oregano, and some green onions. I will keep this recipe and use it over and over.

751,Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce,4.6,"(5,744)","4,462",5 mins,5 mins,10 mins,4,4 servings,"Alfredo sauce is always a good idea. Just toss the indulgent sauce with pasta (and maybe some chicken or shrimp) to create a crowd-pleasing meal that even picky eaters will enjoy. This top-rated Alfredo sauce recipe contains shortcut ingredients that will make your next weeknight dinner a breeze. Plus, learn how to thicken, store, and freeze Alfredo sauce for the most delicious results. Alfredo sauce is a creamy pasta sauce that's frequently paired with fettuccine. The iconic dish, fettuccine Alfredo, is an Italian menu staple. According to legend, the dish was invented by a Roman chef named Alfredo di Lelio in the early 1900s. Di Lelio's pregnant wife was struggling to keep any food down, so he tossed pasta in the simple buttery sauce of his own creation. He added fettuccine Alfredo to his restaurant's menu soon after. Traditional Alfredo sauce consists of butter, heavy cream, Parmesan cheese, and basic seasonings such as salt and pepper. This simple recipe, though, has a secret ingredient that speeds up the cooking process and makes it extra indulgent: cream cheese. Here's what you'll need to make Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce: ButterYou can't make homemade Alfredo sauce without butter. The thick, velvety base adds creaminess and rich flavor. Make sure to use real butter for the most indulgent results. If you use unsalted butter, make sure to add salt to taste. Cream CheeseNot only does cream cheese add thickness and pleasant tanginess, it eliminates the need to stand over the stove making a roux. Garlic PowderTwo teaspoons of garlic powder add Italian-inspired flavor. For a stronger flavor, use fresh garlic. MilkWhole milk adds creaminess, richness, and helps create the perfect smooth texture. Parmesan CheeseParmesan thickens the sauce and adds irresistible cheesy flavor. Grate your own block instead of using shredded cheese if you can. If you don't have Parmesan, you can try substituting Gruyère or mozzarella. PepperAromatic black pepper adds depth and enhances the other flavors. It's the perfect finishing touch. This Alfredo sauce is much easier to make than more traditional recipes that require you to make a roux with flour and milk. You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect: Before you start making the sauce, go ahead and prep any other ingredients you'll be using in your dish (like pasta and chicken). Your sauce will be ready to toss and serve as soon as it's done cooking. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat, then whisk in the cream cheese and garlic powder. When the first three ingredients form a smooth sauce, start gradually whisking the milk into the mixture. It's important to add the milk a little at a time to prevent lumps and to ensure a thick texture. Add the cheese and pepper last. Stir the sauce until it's smooth and glossy. Toss the sauce with pasta, chicken, and/or other ingredients that are necessary for your dish. Serve immediately. This recipe is already quite thick. If you want an even thicker sauce, though, consider making a slurry to add at the end. Just whisk a tablespoon of cornstarch into two tablespoons of cold water. When the ingredients are combined, slowly add the slurry to the sauce. Repeat until the desired thickness is reached. Since Alfredo sauce is heavy on the dairy, you shouldn't let it sit at room temperature for more than two hours. Keep homemade Alfredo sauce in an airtight storage container in the fridge for about three days. Yes! You can absolutely freeze Alfredo sauce — and you should if you don't plan to use it within a few days. To freeze homemade Alfredo sauce, simply ladle it into zip-top freezer bags labeled with the date. Freeze for up to three months. Reheat it on the stove over medium-low heat, stirring constantly for a smooth texture. ""Wow,"" raves KELLYJELLO, who suggests serving with a simple Caesar salad. ""Creamy, creamy, creamy! I made this twice in one week. The secret really is the cream cheese. A very sensual meal served hot over linguine or fettuccine.""

But it's a great innovative recipe....this one is staying with me!"" ""​​YUM!!!!!!!!!! I love Italian food, and this was absolutely the best Alfredo sauce I've had,"" says Jen.

Over a thousand home cooks agree — this simple, savory recipe is a winner. But what if you don't have a wok on hand? Learn the best methods for making fried rice at home, from a griddle to Instant Pot preparation. Fried rice is a traditional Chinese preparation of cooked rice, vegetables, protein, soy sauce, and aromatics. The ingredients are stir-fried in a large pan or wok for even flavor distribution. An ideal use for leftovers, fried rice is quick, customizable, and incredibly simple to put together with whatever is in your fridge. Making fried rice is a breeze with the recipe you'll find below. The process is simple — preheat your pan before swirling in oil and aromatics, then add uncooked proteins if applicable. Add in rice and vegetables, vigorously tossing ingredients for that toasty, golden-brown color that signals big flavor. Wok This ancient cooking vessel is the most commonly used (and convenient) method for cooking fried rice. The large, high-walled pan allows for rice and other components to be tossed and combined with seasonings at high heat. Preheat your wok until a bead of water evaporates after contact, then add oil and coat the surface by swirling. Standard Pan A basic frying pan or skillet can also produce tasty fried rice in a pinch. Approach this method the same way you would a wok — high heat is key. Use the largest pan at your disposal to prevent food from flying out of the pan during the stir-fry process. Griddle Using a griddle to make fried rice is an ingenious way to cook different elements all at the same time. Start by sauteing the vegetables and aromatics, then add cooked rice and eggs to another part of the griddle's surface for a quick and satisfying meal. Instant Pot Day-old rice is transformed into a deeply savory delight in a pressure cooker. Use the Instant Pot's saute mode to get the garlic to a golden-brown color, then stir in rice, veggies, and eggs. Mix well and serve piping hot. One of the best things about this top-rated dish is how easy it is to customize. Whatever you have on hand goes — chicken, shrimp, salmon, and kimchi all make mouthwatering additions to fried rice.

This top-rated recipe for air-fried potato wedges is one you'll come back to again and again. Opt for a starchy potato variety, such as russet potatoes or Yukon Golds, for perfect results.

Place the cut side of the potato onto the cutting board and cut it in half again to create quarters. Repeat with the other half. Now, position each potato quarter with the cut side up and cut down the center of each quarter to create a wedge. Repeat with the other quarters until the entire potato is cut into wedges.

761,Kickin' Collard Greens,4.8,"(1,796)","1,354",10 mins,1 hrs,1 hrs 10 mins,6,6 servings,"Southern-style collard greens are savory comfort food with a deliciously zesty kick. This classic, down-home side dish features fresh chopped collard greens cooked with crumbled bacon and chicken broth for a perfectly tender finish. Learn how to make this tantalizingly spicy Southern recipe and bring the meat and three right to your door. Plus, get the best methods for storing and freezing. Simple pantry ingredients and affordable produce come together to make this treasured dish. Bacon, garlic, and onion create the flavor base, while chicken broth acts as the braising liquid. Red pepper flakes add a fiery element that you can dial up or down based on preference. Since collard greens grow in the ground, you'll want to give them a good wash before you use them. You can wash the greens cut or whole, but we suggest washing after cutting for the most thorough clean (just remember to rinse the cutting board and knife, too). Start by pulling or cutting the woody stem away from the leaves. Roughly cut the greens into two-inch pieces or strips. Culinary producer Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. NicoleMcMom) recommends rolling or folding the large leaves to make the process a little quicker and easier. Once the greens are cut, it's time to wash. Submerge the greens in water (using a large bowl or salad spinner) and allow the grit to fall to the bottom. Drain in a colander and rinse again under running water. Making a tender, flavorful pot of collard greens couldn't be easier. You'll find the full recipe below with step-by-step instructions, but here's what you can expect when you make this top-rated recipe; Begin by cooking bacon slices in a skillet until crisp. Remove the bacon from heat, crumble, and add back to the pan along with chopped onion and garlic. Next, add fresh cut collard greens to the mixture. Cook them gently, just until they begin to wilt, before pouring in broth and seasonings. Reduce heat and let the collard greens cook low and slow — about 45 minutes will result in silky, spicy greens that any Southern grandma would be proud to serve. These classic collard greens pair perfectly with all kinds of Southern dishes, from fried chicken to country ham. Nicole suggests serving them with barbecue chicken and cornbread for a down-home meal that'll please everyone at your table. Before cooking, fresh (and unwashed) collard greens can be stored in the refrigerator for four to five days. They can also be frozen ahead of time — blanched greens can last for months in the freezer before cooking. What about leftovers? Southern collard greens are usually cooked in large batches, so freezing the remaining portions is a great way to have a delicious side dish on hand when you're short on time. Freeze cooked collard greens in small plastic bags as-is. They'll last up to 12 months. ""I just cooked these greens with black-eyed peas, cornbread, and pork chops, "" shares home cook Shelby. ""We're in the South and my husband has eaten A LOT of collards. He's raving right now!"" ""Just the right balance of flavors,"" says reviewer Alexis.

This top-rated recipe is super easy to throw together on a whim – and it puts the store-bought stuff to shame. Learn how to make the best pizza crust of your life with just a few ingredients, find out how to shape the dough, and get our best storage secrets. You need just five ingredients (plus some warm water) to make this super simple pizza crust. YeastActive dry yeast is a leavening agent, which means it's the ingredient that causes the pizza dough to rise. SugarTo activate your yeast, you'll need to dissolve it in warm water with a teaspoon of sugar. The sugar gives the yeast something to eat and speeds up the activation process. You'll know your yeast is active when it becomes bubbly and frothy on top. Bread FlourBread flour is ideal for pizza crust becauseit creates chewier results than all-purpose flour. This is because it contains more protein, which helps produce lots of gluten. Gluten is what gives the crust elasticity. Olive OilOlive oil serves a couple purposes when it comes to pizza crust: Not only does it add color and flavor, but it creates a barrier between the oil and water. This oily barrier prevents sogginess. SaltA little bit of salt goes a long way. Salt adds flavor, strengthens the gluten (creating a chewier crust), and slows down fermentation (resulting in a better rise). Stretching pizza dough is the most hands-on part of the pizza crust-making process. It takes a little practice, but it's as easy as pie (pun intended). To shape the dough: After you're finished mixing the ingredients, allow your dough to rest on the counter for about 30 minutes. This will allow the gluten to relax, making the dough much easier to stretch and shape. Cold dough is much more difficult to work with. You might feel inclined to prep your workspace with a big handful of flour to prevent sticking. This is a helpful step with many kinds of dough. However, in this case, too much flour can make your pizza crust tough. Instead, rub your surface (and your hands) with a few tablespoons of olive oil and maybe a little bit of flour. This will prevent sticking, encourage a crispy texture, and ensure a gorgeous golden color. You have a few options when it comes to shaping the dough. Stretch it in the air, use a rolling pin, or pat it with your hands. No matter which method you choose, make sure not to overwork the dough. Working it too much will create a tough texture. When you're done, you should have an even circle that's about 10 to 12 inches wide and about ⅓-inch thick. If you get too thin, the crust may not be able to support the sauce and toppings. This pizza dough will last for about five days in the fridge. Store it in an airtight storage container or a bowl tightly covered with storage wrap. Allow the refrigerated dough to sit for about 30 minutes at room temperature before using. Yes! You can absolutely freeze pizza dough. This is a great option for people who make pizza often. Prepare the dough for freezing by rolling it into a ball and lightly coating it with oil. Place the ball in a freezer-safe container labeled with the date. Freeze for about three months. To thaw the dough, simply transfer it to the fridge the night before you plan to use it. ""This crust 'makes' my pizza,"" says Kandi Brooks. ""I sprinkle a bit of Parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning on the top before adding the pizza sauce. It's quick and simple and delicious!"" ""Super quick and very easy,"" according to Lin Snow.

788,Downeast Maine Pumpkin Bread,4.8,"(10,229)","7,739",15 mins,50 mins,1 hrs 5 mins,24,2 loaves,"When fall is in the air, can't you just smell a delicious loaf of freshly baked pumpkin bread? Or is that just those of us who dream about pumpkin bread all day? No matter. Either way, moist and flavorful pumpkin bread is the perfect way to use up the cans of pumpkin puree you stocked up on at the first sign of autumn. And what better recipe to use than this Downeast Maine Pumpkin Bread? It's so beloved by members of the Allrecipes community, they have rated it 5 stars over 8,000 times. The great news is that pumpkin bread is actually incredibly easy to make — you don't even need an electric mixer (though, of course it helps). Simply combine your wet ingredients, then combine your dry ingredients, then combine them all together. Pour into two loaf pans. The best part about this recipe is that it makes two loaves, so you can have one for now and one for later — or one for gifting! This recipe calls for canned pumpkin puree (make sure it's plain pumpkin, not pumpkin pie filling), which is quicker and easier than using fresh pumpkin. But, if you are feeling ambitious and want to use fresh pumpkin, follow this recipe to make pumpkin puree from scratch. A 1 ½-pound sugar pumpkin will make about 2 cups of mashed pumpkin, which is the same as a 15-ounce can of pumpkin puree. Pumpkin bread is pretty dense, so it might be hard to know when it's cooked all the way through (and the last thing you want is to serve up a bread that's raw in the middle). So, to know when pumpkin bread is done, look for the crack on the top of the bread, which is a tell-tale sign it's either done or close to being done. Then stick a skewer or toothpick into the center of the bread. If it comes out clean, it's ready to come out of the oven. If not, leave it to bake for a few more minutes, then check again with a clean toothpick. Sometimes removing quick breads from their loaf pan is a tricky task. So, before you add the batter, make sure you thoroughly grease the pan. Then, after you've let the bread cool for about 10 minutes (or until you can handle the pan), run a knife along the edges of the bread. Gently shake the pan until the bread comes loose and you can turn it out onto a wire rack or plate. Then, let the bread continue to cool. You may be tempted to cut right into the bread, but you should let it cool completely before slicing into it. Pumpkin bread may be an easy quick bread to make, but sometimes recipes don't always turn out as planned. If you're having one of these common mistakes, here's how to fix it: If you have a tough bread instead of a soft, cake-like texture, you're probably overmixing your batter. When making quick breads, you don't want to mix too much or else the gluten development will cause your bread to change in texture. Mix your ingredients until they are just combined — you should still have some lumps in the batter. Dry pumpkin bread is such a disappointment. To avoid dry, crumbly bread, try to keep your batter moist. Either do this by using less flour or adding more liquid — but don't add more oil. Instead, try adding orange juice or even bourbon to get some liquid into the batter. Wait until the bread is completely cool, then wrap it in plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Store it in a cool, dry place for up to four days, or in the refrigerator for up to one week. ""Awesome recipe!! Very easy to make. Just put in a bowl and use your hand or stand mixer. That simple. I just made it this morning and I tried it four hours later. Wonderful!!! Can't wait till tomorrow, I don't know how it can taste any better"" says KIMMIE5474.

Tasting like pull-apart sticky buns, monkey bread is easy to make with everyday pantry ingredients, and can be customized with add-ins like dried fruits, nuts, and spices to suit your tastes. And with thousands of ratings and reviews, this is one of our best monkey bread recipes. I'll show you how to make this top-rated recipe for monkey bread, with plenty of how-to tips to guarantee success. Monkey bread is a pull-apart bread made with bite-size pieces of dough coated with sugar and spice and baked with a buttery brown sugar sauce in a tube or Bundt pan. To serve monkey bread, invert it onto a large plate and let everyone pull it apart into individual pieces with their fingers or forks. That's a good question without a definitive answer. Some say it's called monkey bread because you pick the bread apart with your fingers as though you're eating like a monkey, and some say it's because the baked monkey bread resembles the zigzag pattern of a monkey puzzle tree (Chilean pine). More: Our Best Monkey Bread Recipes of All Time These are the ingredients you'll need for this monkey bread recipe: · Biscuit dough: This recipe uses cut-up pieces of canned biscuit dough as a convenient shortcut ingredient.· Sugar and cinnamon: Used to coat biscuit dough pieces both for flavor and to make them easier to pull apart after baking. You can substitute other ground spices such as cardamom or a pumpkin spice blend.· Walnuts (optional): You could substitute pecans or leave out the nuts altogether.· Raisins (optional): You could substitute dried cranberries or other small bits of dried fruit.· Margarine and brown sugar: Combined and briefly boiled to create the sweet caramel-like sauce that holds the monkey bread together. Many reviewers use butter instead of margarine. Be sure to pack down the brown sugar firmly into the measuring cup to get the correct amount. Some home cooks recommend adding about ¼ cup cream or milk to help keep the sauce soft even after it cools. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this top-rated monkey bread: 1. Cut the biscuits into quarters and coat in cinnamon-sugar.2. Arrange the pieces in the pan. Add the raisins and nuts among the pieces if you're using them.3. Boil the brown sugar and margarine, then pour over the biscuits.4. Bake the monkey bread in the preheated oven. Get more tips for How to Make Monkey Bread. Monkey bread is meant to be pulled apart and eaten with fingers or forks. There's no need to cut and slice. It's best when served warm and the sauce is still soft and sticky, but it's good eaten cold as well. We recommend using a Bundt pan or one-piece tube pan to make monkey bread because the shape of the pan allows hot air to circulate to the middle of the bread and bake the dough evenly. But if you don't have a Bundt or tube pan, you can make monkey bread in a large loaf pan, cake pan, or 9x13 pan. Use a large enough pan to allow for the biscuits to expand. You may have to adjust your baking time so the biscuit pieces are fully baked in the center of the monkey bread. Monkey bread can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for three or four days. You can wrap and freeze baked monkey bread for up to three months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator. ""Fun to make & delicious to eat! I cut the recipe into ⅓ and only used 1 can of biscuits in an 8"" round cake pan. Cooked for about 20 minutes. My 2½-year-old enjoyed helping me roll the balls. Also, previous reviewer suggested using a pizza cutter to cut the biscuits —great shortcut,"" says Allrecipes home cook BBURG_HOKIES. Reviewer Stephanie C offers this tip: ""Scrumptious! I used frozen yeast roll dough to get a more homemade yeast bread flavor and the results were outstanding! You can make it the night before this way: Thaw 18 golf ball-size raw yeast rolls over about an hour. Once thawed, cut each in half. Follow the recipe for coating and layering. After pouring the brown sugar mixture over dough, place in cold oven overnight to rise. Follow baking instructions in the morning. Absolutely perfect! The entire extended family loved it!"" ""The only tips I could offer would be to make sure you don't press down on the dough balls once you get them in the pan, or else the sauce won't make it all the way through the loaf and get it all gooey and delicious on the inside. Also, I'd make about 50 percent more sauce than the recipe calls for, because people seem to go for the parts that have the most sauce,"" says reviewer JenniJ3333.

Irish soda bread is a type of quick bread that relies on baking soda, not yeast, to rise. The bread contains buttermilk, which contains lactic acid. The acid reacts with the baking soda to create air bubbles, resulting in a perfectly risen dough. Soda bread became incredibly common during the Irish Potato Famine, as you can make it with only four ingredients: flour, salt, an acid, and baking soda. These are the basic, easy-to-find ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated Irish soda bread recipe: · Flour: This classic Irish soda bread starts with all-purpose flour.· Margarine: Margarine has a higher water content than butter, so the results are often softer. If you want, you can substitute Irish butter.· Sugar: Four tablespoons of sugar add the perfect amount of sweetness.· Leaveners: Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the bread rise.· Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor of the Irish soda bread.· Buttermilk: A cup of buttermilk adds flavor and helps the loaf rise even higher.· Egg: An egg lends richness and flavor. Plus, it helps bind the dough together.· Butter: Brush the unbaked loaf with a mixture of buttermilk and butter before you bake it for extra flavor and shine. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade Irish soda bread: 1. Combine the first six ingredients in a bowl. Stir in the buttermilk and egg.2. Turn the dough out and knead. Form the dough into a round loaf.3. Brush with butter and buttermilk, then cut an X in the top.4. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Wrap the cooled Irish soda bread tightly in storage wrap or place it in an airtight container.

This tried-and-true recipe is beloved by the Allrecipes community because it's easy to make with just five ingredients, it calls for kitchen staples you probably already have on hand, and it's absolutely delicious. Here's what you'll need to make this top-rated biscuit recipe: FlourAll-purpose flour holds the ingredients together. Also, the protein in flour (when combined with moisture and heat) creates gluten, which provides structure. Baking PowderBaking powder, not yeast, is used as a leavener in this easy biscuit recipe. It causes the dough to expand, giving the biscuits volume and texture. SaltSalt acts as a flavor enhancer and it strengthens the protein in the dough. ShorteningShortening is made of purely fat, unlike butter which contains water and milk solids. This means it's better at reducing (or ""shortening!"") gluten strands, resulting in a soft and crumbly biscuit. MilkCold milk adds moisture, flavor, and structure to the biscuit dough. You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect: Sift the dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, and salt) into a large bowl. Cut in the shortening, then add the milk. Mix until the dough is soft and doesn't stick to the side of the bowl. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly. Roll the dough into an even sheet that's about ½-inch thick. Use a lightly floured biscuit cutter to cut out the biscuits. Place the cut biscuits on an ungreased baking sheet. Re-roll the dough, repeating the cutting process, until all the dough is gone. Bake in an oven preheated to 450 degrees F until golden brown. Top your biscuits with homemade sausage gravy, jam, honey butter, or the spread of your choice. You can also pair them with breakfast meats — such as bacon, sausage, or chicken — or serve them with a hearty soup or stew (you can't go wrong with a classic beef stew).

If you don't have a go-to yet, you're in luck! Chef John's take on classic buttermilk biscuits is a favorite in the Allrecipes community. Best of all, it's easy to make with ingredients you probably have on hand. Buttermilk is used in biscuit-making for its acid and fat content. Its acidity works with the leaveners to help the dough rise, producing a taller and fluffier biscuit. Buttermilk also adds a subtle tang. Cream biscuits are made with heavy cream. Cream biscuits are beloved because they're incredibly easy-to-make. But, since cream is much milder than buttermilk, they won't be quite as flavorful (unless you incorporate more spices and seasonings). Also, cream biscuits will likely not rise as high as buttermilk biscuits, especially if the recipe doesn't contain enough leavener.

No one will be able to say no to these rolls — especially when they're warm right out of the oven. You'll only need a few pantry staple ingredients for this recipe: FlourOf course, bread needs flour. Use all-purpose flour for the best results. YeastThis recipe calls for RapidRise yeast, which is what we recommend you use. However, you can use active yeast, you'll just have to follow the directions on the package. Whatever yeast you use, make sure it's not expired or else the dough won't rise. SugarTwo tablespoons of sugar is all you need to add a hint of sweetness. SaltSalt adds a touch of flavor. MilkWarm milk will activate the yeast, moisten the dough, and keep it soft while it bakes. ButterButter adds a rich flavor to the rolls. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below, but here's what you can expect when making dinner rolls from scratch: Combine flour, sugar, undissolved yeast, salt, warm milk, water, and butter in a bowl. Beat with an electric mixer, adding more flour as needed, for a few minutes. Continuously scrape down the sides. Turn the dough out onto a floured and knead until smooth and elastic. Cover and let the dough rise. This should only take 10 minutes if you're using fast-acting instant yeast (like Fleischmann's RapidRise Yeast). Cut and shape the dough into rolls and place on a greased baking sheet. Cover and let rise in a warm place until the rolls have doubled in size. Bake the proofed rolls until golden brown. Brush with melted butter and serve warm.

Even though these rolls only take about an hour and a half to make, you can break up the prep time by shaping the dough into rolls and then refrigerating them before the second rise. You can leave the rolls in the fridge overnight. Then, when you're ready to bake, allow the rolls to come to room temperature. Proof them for about 30 minutes (or until they're doubled in size). Bake as directed. Store your rolls in an airtight container or zip-top bag at room temperature for up to three days. To extend their life, you can store them in the refrigerator for up to a week. Reheat dinner rolls in the oven for about 10 minutes, or until they're warmed through. For a quicker method, you can also reheat them in the microwave for 30 to 45 seconds. Freezing dinner rolls is simple: Just place completely cooled rolls in a zip-top freezer bag and store in the freezer for up to three months. Thaw in the fridge and reheat in the oven. You can also freeze the dinner roll dough for easy baking later. Place the shaped dough (before the second rise) on a baking sheet and into the freezer. Let the dough freeze overnight until it's frozen solid. Then, place the frozen dough balls into a zip-top freezer bag and store in the freezer for up to three months. When you're ready to bake, take the dough balls out of the freezer and place them on a baking sheet. Let the dough thaw and rise for about 4 to 5 hours. Bake as directed. ""This recipe is awesome.

""I too used regular dry yeast since I did not have RapidRise yeast and used my Kitchen Aid mixer with the dough hook. I simply let the buns rise longer than the recipe called for and baked.

If not, here's what to add to your grocery list: · Flour: This scone recipe starts with all-purpose flour.· Sugar: You'll need white sugar for the dough and to top the scones.· Leaveners: Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the scones rise.· Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor of the scones.· Butter: Make sure the butter is frozen before you incorporate it into the dough for the flakiest results.· Raisins: You can also use dried currants.· Sour cream: Sour cream lends moisture and subtle tangy flavor.· Egg: An egg adds moisture and helps bind the scone dough together. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make scones at home: 1. Mix the dry ingredients, then work the butter into the dough using your fingers.2. Add the raisins.3. Whisk the sour cream and egg together.4. Stir the egg mixture into the flour mixture.5.

You'll find the full recipe below with step-by-step instructions, but here's what you can expect when you make this top-rated recipe; Combine eggs, milk, and flour in a sizable bowl.

Serve as-is or with your choice of filling. Yorkshire pudding is traditionally eaten as a part of a roast beef dinner, but there are many ways this cup-like British pudding can be served. Try a crowd-friendly Toad in the Hole recipe or a classic roast beef pairing for an authentic U.K.-inspired meal. Cooked Yorkshire pudding will last for up to three days in the refrigerator if stored in an airtight container. Reheat in a 400 degrees F oven for best results.

Bake the best chocolate muffins of your life with this top-rated recipe. This chocolate muffin recipe utilizes a secret, moisture-packed ingredient to keep dryness at bay: yogurt! It also calls for milk, vegetable oil, and a whole egg — all ingredients that help add and retain moisture. You might already have everything you need to make these moist chocolate muffins on hand. If not, here's what you'll need to put on your grocery list: FlourAll-purpose flour gives structure to baked goods and helps hold the batter together. SugarOne cup of white sugar adds the perfect amount of sweetness. Cocoa Powder and Chocolate ChipsThis muffin recipe has a double dose of chocolatey flavor. You'll need a cup of chocolate chips and a ½ cup of cocoa powder. Baking SodaA teaspoon of baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the batter rise and ensures a light and fluffy result. YogurtNot only does yogurt add a ton of moisture, it lends subtle tang to the chocolate muffins. MilkMilk moistens the batter, adds flavor, and helps create a soft texture. OilThis recipe calls for vegetable oil, but canola oil would also work. EggA whole egg is yet another moisture imparting ingredient. Also, it helps bind the batter together and gives the muffins a rich flavor. VanillaA teaspoon of vanilla extract adds complexity and helps enhance the overall flavor. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's what you can expect when you make these top-rated chocolate muffins: Mix the dry ingredients (flour, sugar, 3/4 cup chocolate chips, cocoa powder, and baking soda) in one bowl and the wet ingredients (yogurt, milk, oil, egg, and vanilla) in another. Pour the yogurt mixture into the flour mixture, then stir until smooth. Prepare a muffin tin with muffin liners. Fill the liners about ¾ full, then sprinkle the remaining chocolate chips over the top. Bake in a preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool in the pan for about 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Allow the muffins to cool completely before transferring them to an airtight container lined with paper towels. Arrange them in a single layer, then place a paper towel on top to absorb excess moisture. Seal the container and store at room temperature for about four days. Want to go the extra mile to prevent your muffins from getting mushy? Here's a genius tip from Allrecipes community member ValerieB333: ""To keep topping from being soggy the next day, put a few saltine crackers in with the muffins when you store them (to absorb moisture).

Everyone will love the taste of these cinnamon-packed yeast rolls with a sweet and sticky pecan glaze (and you'll love that they only take 35 minutes of active work to make). Say ""goodbye"" to store-bought cinnamon buns forever — you'll be making this recipe until the end of time. Cinnamon buns, also called cinnamon rolls, originated in Europe. They were brought to America by German and Swedish immigrants and have since become a sweet breakfast staple across the country. You'll find the step-by-step recipe below, but here's what you can expect when making these cinnamon buns: Activate the yeast by combining water, sugar, and yeast. Let stand until the mixture is foamy. Then combine, warm milk, sugar, butter, and salt until melted. Add both the milk and yeast mixtures to a bowl with eggs and flour. Mix until a dough forms. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead until smooth. Place dough in an oil-coated bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Allow to rise until the dough has doubled in size. Mix butter and brown sugar in a saucepan over medium heat until smooth. Pour glaze into a greased baking pan and top with ½ cup of pecans. Melt butter and set it aside. Combine brown sugar, pecans, and cinnamon in another bowl. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and roll it into a rectangle. Brush the dough with butter, then sprinkle with the filling mixture. Roll the dough tightly into a spiral and top with the rest of the melted butter. Cut the dough into equal-sized cinnamon buns and place them in the pan with the glaze (cut-side down). Cover the pan and let the buns rise until doubled in size. Bake the cinnamon buns until golden brown. Invert the pan so the glaze is on the top. Add any remaining glaze from the pan to the cinnamon buns. Learn more: How to Make Homemade Cinnamon Rolls From Scratch If you follow this recipe, you should have perfect cinnamon buns in 25 to 30 minutes. You'll know the cinnamon rolls are done when the tops are golden brown. This recipe calls for a simple glaze made with butter and brown sugar.

""I made the rolls the night before, placing the pan in the fridge overnight still covered with the damp cloth from the first rise. Perfect! Take them out about 35 minutes before you plan to bake and let them come to room temperature. Bake as directed.

Whip up restaurant-quality bread with toasted edges and a pillowy interior. This easy naan recipe yields deliciously puffy, garlicky results that are the perfect accompaniment to curries, soups, and dips. Learn to make foolproof naan with this 5-star recipe — plus, learn how to store and what to serve with this popular bread. Naan (pronounced nahn) is an oven-baked, leavened bread that is stuffed and flavored in a variety of ways. An essential part of South and Central Asian cuisine, naan is easy, affordable, and makes the most of pantry ingredients you already have on hand. Flour, yeast, milk, and butter make a tender dough that's simply seasoned with garlic and salt, but there is a wide array of naan bread flavors. You'll find everything from coconut and raisin-stuffed bread to saucy lamb-topped naan in restaurants and home kitchens around the world. Naan is similar to other baked flatbreads but has a few distinguishing characteristics. Naan is enriched with ingredients like yogurt, milk, and eggs, while pita uses water to moisten its dough, making naan the softer bread. Roti is generally thinner and coarser than naan as it uses stoneground flour and is unleavened. While naan's fillings are baked right in, roti is traditionally served and filled with whatever main dish it accompanies. Making delightfully soft homemade naan is easier than you think. You'll find the full recipe below with step-by-step instructions, but here's what you can expect when you make this top-rated recipe: Start by making an easy egg-enriched yeast dough, then let it rise for one hour. Next, punch the dough down and knead in minced garlic or other desired fillings before letting it rise a second time. Cook the naan dough on a grill pan over high heat until golden brown and puffy. Homemade garlic naan is a bold, flavorful bread that's made for dipping. Serve naan with a fragrant dal full of warm spices and slow-cooked veggies, or opt for a citrusy chicken curry. Top naan bread like a pizza and share with friends — it's a versatile recipe that allows you to customize it. Naan bread can be stored at room temperature for up to three days. Allow naan bread to fully cool before wrapping it in an airtight plastic bag for best results. To reheat, sprinkle the bread with a bit of water before baking at 350 degrees F until crisp.

840,The REAL Long Island Iced Tea,4.7,(105),76,10 mins,,10 mins,1,1 drink,"One thing must be cleared up about the Long Island Iced Tea straight away: It is living a lie. For starters, it's not entirely clear that it's actually from Long Island. That's debatable. But, folks, it is most assuredly not tea. You will not find a drop of tea in this cocktail. But don't hold that against it. Read on to learn how to make this 5-star recipe for Long Island Iced Tea. Some people have asked, does the Long Island iced tea have alcohol in it? Boy does it ever! The Long Island iced tea is the liquor-cabinet equivalent of what the kids once called a ""suicide soda"" (a big ol' splash of every drink from the soda fountain into one enormous ice-filled cup). On the face of it, the Long Island Iced tea doesn't seem tenable: Vodka, rum, gin, tequila, triple sec — all mingling in the same cocktail glass, tempered only by a dash of sweet and sour mix and a splash of cola. Sounds like trouble. And obviously it can be. But it's undisputable, this cocktail proves itself an unlikely success, and a prime example of when the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Tossing all of these strong spirits together somehow softens the edges off of each individual spirit. It's a marvel of science, frankly. Somehow this cocktail, seemingly of odds and ends from the liquor cabinet, manages the impossible: it actually tastes good. Very good. So be careful out there, folks. You'll find the full recipe with all the ingredients and measurements, below, but making a Long Island Iced Tea couldn't be easier. Fill a cocktail shaker with ice. Add all the various alcohols plus the sweet and sour mix. Hold aside the cola for now. Cover the cocktail shaker and give it a good shake to let all the spirits mix and chill. The Long Island Iced Tea is typically served in a Collins glass or a hurricane glass over a lot of fresh ice with a big splash of cola poured over the top, which creates that tea-like color.

842,The Real Mojito,4.8,(760),526,10 mins,,10 mins,1,1 cocktail,"This Cuban cocktail is a blend of a few simple ingredients, but the resulting drink is the perfect balance of sweet and tart, not to mention refreshing! What makes this a five-star recipe? It stays true to the original mojito with real, fresh ingredients. The recipe makes one serving, but you can easily scale it up to make a pitcher for summertime entertaining. A mojito is a classic highball drink that originated in Cuba. Not surprisingly, this cocktail uses ingredients indigenous to Cuba, including rum, lime, mint, and sugar. The mixture is topped off with a little club soda to create a thirst-quenching libation. It requires a bit more labor than many mixed drinks, as it involves first muddling fresh mint, lime, and sugar together to release the flavors. But it's well worth it for a refreshing, fizzy, and mildly sweet rum cocktail that remains one of the most popular to this day. Always use white rum for mojitos. Avoid spiced rums, because these will take away from the freshness of the mint and lime. Spearmint is most commonly used for mojitos and is what you'll likely find at the grocery store labeled generically as ""mint."" For an authentic Cuban mojito, use mojito mint, or Mentha x villosa, a type of mint native to Cuba with a more understated flavor than that of spearmint. Use freshly squeezed limes for best flavor. When shopping for limes, look for fruits with smooth skin, as this indicates the fruit is full of juice. Folks often substitute simple syrup for sugar in mojitos because it blends into the drink more smoothly. However, classic mojito recipes call for granulated sugar. Not only does this ensure the drink isn't overly sweet, but the occasional undissolved sugar granule adds texture that's signature to a classic mojito. If you prefer, you can use superfine/caster sugar in place of granulated sugar, as this will dissolve more easily into cold liquid. Top everything off with club soda to lighten up the drink and balance out the other ingredients. As with most cocktails, crafting mojitos requires a few special tools — namely, a muddler. This bartending tool is used to crush fresh herbs and fruits to help release their flavors. If you don't have a muddler, use the end of a wooden spoon instead. ""Light, refreshing and a perfect blend of tart and sweet,"" says reviewer winelight. ""Plan to make 2 or more pitchers if you have more than a couple of friends,"" says reviewer LeslieRN72. ""These mojitos go down easily and are gone in a flash!"" ""This is the closest I've found to a real mojito like your favorite bartender will mix for you,"" says reviewer Stenner.

With this copycat caramel Frappuccino recipe, you can make the sweet treat at home – and save money in the long run! Frappuccino is a type of blended coffee drink that is trademarked by Starbucks. Made with ice, coffee, and flavored syrups, the beverage's flavor and texture is somewhere between a milkshake and an iced coffee. The word ""Frappuccino"" is a combination of ""lait frappe"" (a type of French milkshake) and ""cappuccino"" (an espresso-based coffee drink with steamed milk). You need just five ingredients to make this copycat Starbucks caramel Frappuccino recipe: IceIce is the base of this caramel Frappuccino recipe. Crushed ice is best (and more blender-friendly), but cubed ice will work too. Brewed CoffeeMake sure the coffee is strong so it's not overpowered by the other ingredients. Also, it's important to ensure the coffee is completely cooled so it doesn't melt the ice. MilkLow-fat milk, when combined with ice, creates an irresistible texture that's the perfect blend of creamy and icy. Caramel SauceIf you want to get fancy, drizzle the caramel sauce on the inside of the glass before you pour in the Frappuccino. SugarSweeten things up a bit with white sugar.

849,Sangria! Sangria!,4.8,"(1,770)","1,306",15 mins,,15 mins,6,,"When you need a crowd-pleasing cocktail, sangria is the obvious choice. A pitcher of sangria is the perfect summer drink to sip on at your backyard barbecue or party. So, let us introduce you to the best sangria recipe on the internet. It's easy to make and, even better, it's irresistibly delicious. Sangria is an alcoholic punch that originated in Spain and Portugal. There are two common varieties: red sangria and white sangria. It's typically made with wine, liqueur, sparkling water, fruit juice, and lots of sliced fruit. Learn more: What Is Sangria? There are many variations of sangria ingredients, but this recipe for the best sangria calls for: · Red Wine: Opt for a dry, fruity Spanish red wine.· Brandy: Brandy adds an extra sweet and fruity flavor to the sangria.· Triple Sec: Choose a high-quality triple sec for an extra punch of orange flavor.· Fruit Juice:This recipe calls for orange juice, lemon juice, and frozen lemonade concentrate.· Sugar (Optional): If you like your sangria sweeter, add some white sugar.· Carbonated Water (Optional): Add carbonated water for a little fizz, if you like.· Fruit: This recipe calls for sliced lemon, orange, lime, and maraschino cherries. Any dry red wine will work, but we like to use fruity Spanish wine, such as Garnacha for the best flavor results. It doesn't have to be the most expensive bottle either. You'll be adding so many sweet ingredients to the wine that will dress it up. We like to use what this recipe calls for (lemon, orange, lime, and maraschino cherries), but you can really use any in-season fruits that you like. Making the best sangria is so incredibly easy. Simply mix all the liquid ingredients (expect the carbonated water) together in a pitcher, then add the sliced fruit. Refrigerate overnight to allow the flavors to blend. If you're using carbonated water, add it right before serving for the fizziest results. Learn more: How to Make Sangria Culinary producer Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. NicoleMcMom) says ""this might be the best sangria recipe"" she's ever tasted. High praise, indeed! Here are some of Nicole's best tips and tricks for making the perfect sangria every time: · Good sangria starts with a good wine. You can use red or white, but try to stick to something on the drier side. Nicole opted for a chilled Spanish grenache.· You can definitely make this sangria ahead of time. In fact, it'll taste best if you let it chill in the fridge for about eight hours to allow the flavors to meld. Just don't add the carbonated water until right before serving so it stays nice and bubbly.· Get creative! You can easily make this recipe your own by mixing up the ingredients — just make sure the final product includes all the essential elements (wine, liqueur, fruit juice, sweetener, fruit, and effervescence). Sangria will last for about three to five days in the refrigerator if stored in an airtight container. It will only last for a day or two if stored in the pitcher covered with storage wrap, so we recommend moving it to an airtight container if you don't plan on drinking it all within two days. ""This was delicious!!! Instead of buying triple sec, the liquor store sold brandy and orange together, it was very yummy! Also, instead of adding sugar I bought a sweeter wine that was recommended by the sales rep. Otherwise I followed the recipe the same and everyone loved it,"" says NANNOUSE.

Tom Collins is a gin-based cocktail made with lemon juice, simple syrup, and club soda. It's served over ice in a Tom Collins glass. Tom Collins is not named after a real person. Though the recipe likely originated in London, the cocktail's name probably comes from a practical joke that took New York and Philadelphia by storm in the 1870s. It went like this: Someone would ask their friend, ""Do you know Tom Collins?"" When the friend said they did not know Tom Collins, the prankster would say that the nonexistent man was going from bar to bar telling lies about him. The joke was so widespread it was dubbed The Great Tom Collins Hoax of 1874. These are the ingredients you'll need to make a homemade Tom Collins cocktail: · Ice: Traditional Tom Collins cocktails are served over ice.· Gin: Opt for a dry London gin.· Lemon: You'll need lemon juice for the drink itself and a wedge for garnish.· Simple syrup: Use store-bought simple syrup or make your own at home.· Club soda: Club soda is what gives the Tom Collins its signature fizz. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make a Tom Collins at home: 1. Fill a glass with ice and place the glass in the freezer.2. Combine the gin, lemon juice, and syrup in a cocktail shaker. Add ice and shake.3.

857,Classic Bloody Mary,4.4,(55),47,2 mins,,2 mins,1,,"If your brunch menu isn't complete without a Bloody Mary, then you're in luck because you've just found the best Bloody Mary recipe on the internet! Get ready to pile this spicy, savory cocktail high with your favorite toppings — but first, save this recipe to your collection because it's about to become your go-to. The tomato-based cocktail is actually very easy to make with a few simple ingredients: Spicy Tomato Juice CocktailUse your favorite tomato-vegetable juice cocktail, like V8. VodkaVodka is the traditional alcohol in a Bloody Mary. Worcestershire SauceWorcestershire sauce gives the cocktail a savory, umami-rich flavor. Hot Pepper SauceKick up the spice with hot pepper sauce. Salt and PepperSimple salt and pepper add extra flavor. GarnishesThis recipe calls for celery and garlic-stuffed green olives for a garnish — but you can add more if you like. No one is quite sure how the cocktail got its gory name, but there are various theories. One legend says the cocktail was named after Queen Mary Tudor and her bloody reign over England. The red tomato juice is meant to signify the blood shed of the Protestants in the 16th century. However, yet another story claims that the Bloody Mary was named after entertainer George Jessel's friend Mary Geraghty. A traditional Bloody Mary always contains vodka. In fact, if you use any other kind of alcohol, it's not called a Bloody Mary anymore. Tequila and tomato juice? That's a Bloody Maria. What about gin and tomato juice? That's a Red Snapper. Since there are no carbonated ingredients, you can make the entire Bloody Mary in one go in a cocktail shaker. To make this easy cocktail, simply shake all ingredients together in a cocktail shaker. Strain into a glass with ice and garnish. Cheers! When it comes to garnishing a Bloody Mary, the sky is truly the limit. You can put nearly an entire meal on the drink (like a grilled cheese or hamburger slider) or keep it simple with a few pickles, olives, bacon, or shrimp. ""These were great. After sampling these, I made a pitcher, and we doubled the vodka. I also served it with a slice of crisp bacon. I got rave reviews and they looked so great,"" says judynobark.

889,Tom and Jerry Batter,4.8,(74),58,30 mins,,30 mins,72,12 cups,"Need a cup of holiday cheer? We've got you covered with this Tom and Jerry batter recipe! The Tom and Jerry is a classic holiday drink. The incredibly decadent cocktail is made with eggs, butter, spices, milk, and a hefty dose of sugar. The original recipe was a publicity stunt: Writer Pierce Egan debuted a spiked eggnog recipe in the early 1800s to promote the stage adaptation of his book, Tom and Jerry, or Life in London. These are the ingredients you'll need to make crowd-pleasing Tom and Jerry batter: · Eggs: You'll need a whopping 12 eggs for this decadent recipe.· Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor.· Butter: This big-batch Tom and Jerry mix recipe calls for a pound of butter.· Confectioners' sugar: Opt for confectioners' sugar (instead of regular granulated sugar) for the smoothest results.· Vanilla: Vanilla extract adds complexity, enhancing the overall flavor.· Spices: This cozy Tom and Jerry mix is spiced with nutmeg, cloves, and allspice. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this Tom and Jerry mix: 1. Beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.2. Beat the egg yolks in a separate bowl.3. Beat the butter and sugar in a third bowl. Add egg yolks and vanilla.4. Stir in the egg whites and spices until well-blended. Store the Tom and Jerry batter in an airtight container in the refrigerator for about a week. If you go ahead and mix in alcohol (such as rum or brandy), it will keep for a bit longer. You can freeze the Tom and Jerry mix for up to two months. Fill a mug with hot water and spiced rum or brandy (to taste), warm milk, hot cocoa, or eggnog. Top with one heaping tablespoon of Tom and Jerry batter and stir. ""Great recipe and a seasonal favorite at our house,"" raves Kteacher. ""We use white rum, brandy, and a splash of creme de cacao or coffee liqueur. For a kid friendly non-alcoholic version, use chocolate, caramel, or mocha coffee flavoring instead of liquor."" ""It is Christmas Eve in Wisconsin and I am drinking the single best Tom and Jerry of my life, thanks to this recipe,"" says cowgirll. ""Change nothing, this recipe is just right.""

""What does that taste like? These. Seriously. Make them and taste Christmas happiness in your mouth."" These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated persimmon cookie recipe: · Persimmons: These cookies start with pureed persimmons (a.k.a. persimmon pulp).· Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the persimmon cookies rise.· Flour: All-purpose flour creates structure and holds the dough together.· Spices: These persimmon cookies are spiced with cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg. A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor.· Sugar: A cup of white sugar creates perfectly sweet persimmon cookies.· Butter: A stick of butter adds moisture and richness to the cookies.· Egg: An egg adds moisture and acts as a binder, which means it helps hold the cookie dough together.· Raisins and walnuts: Raisins and walnuts (or other nuts) are optional mix-ins. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make these irresistible persimmon cookies: 1. Place the persimmon pulp in a small bowl.

I'm not sure why, but they just don't entice me like other sweet things do. This, however, is one very notable exception. It's almost too good. I find this very hard to stop eating. If you're a fan of apple crumbles, coffee cakes, and Dutch apple pies, this just might become your new favorite dessert recipe. Sorry, I meant new favorite breakfast recipe. But, regardless of what time of day this graces your table, you're going to be enjoying what I think is the perfect combination of moist buttery cake, sweet bits of fruit, and buttery, crunchy crumbs. In fact, don't be surprised if you have it for breakfast and dessert. One of the keys here is to make sure you dice your apples nice and small, so they become perfectly tender by the time your coffee cake is baked. The only way to really mess this up would be to have a bunch of large, crunchy apple pieces inside an otherwise perfect coffee cake. Do not let that happen. Of course, we could hedge our bets and sauté them first, but why add another step?Of course, you don't have to use apples, or any fruit for that matter, and this recipe will still produce a world-class coffee cake, but I hope you do. It's not like they add a ton of health benefits, but a little extra fiber is always a good thing, and that way we won't feel quite as guilty for enjoying this for breakfast and dessert. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to have a piece for lunch. I'll finish by saying I really do hope you give this apple crumble cake a try soon. Enjoy!

Mamaw's Chicken and Rice Casserole is comfort food incarnate. This simple, affordable, and absolutely irresistible meal will warm you up from the inside out. Learn how to make, store, freeze, and serve this easy chicken and rice casserole: This recipe may be rich in flavor, but it's made with deliciously cheap ingredients. Here's what you'll need: Chicken BreastsUse a sharp knife or kitchen shears to cut three boneless, skinless chicken breasts into cubes. You don't have to be too precise, but aim for 1-inch cubes to ensure even cooking. WaterLiquid (in this case water) is essential to any rice-based recipe, as the rice needs something to absorb during the cooking process. White RiceYou can't have a chicken and rice casserole without rice! This convenient recipe calls for instant white rice, which is cheap and readily available at any grocery store. Cream of Chicken Soup, Cream of Celery Soup, and Cream of Mushroom SoupLike many old-fashioned recipes, this chicken and rice casserole relies on canned soups for rich flavor and creamy texture. Salt and PepperSimple seasonings make Mamaw's Chicken and Rice Casserole a crowd-pleaser for all ages. Of course, you can spice things up a bit to suit your flavor preferences. ButterBecause doesn't butter make everything better? ""You can use less butter on top of course,"" says recipe creator katiefbenham. ""My Momma and Mamaw always put the full stick on top (gotta love Southern ladies and their butter!)"" Mamaw's Chicken and Rice Casserole is fantastic as it is, but it lends itself to substitutions and variations. Here are a few ideas to spark your creativity: Rotisserie ChickenTo make things even easier on yourself, you can forgo cooking and cubing chicken breasts in favor of adding shredded rotisserie chicken. BroccoliMany Allrecipes reviewers suggest adding fresh or frozen broccoli florets to the mix for a pop of color and flavor. CheeseShredded Cheddar cheese is a cheap, easy way to amp up the creaminess factor. If you're in the mood to turn up the heat, consider using Pepper Jack. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to four days. It's important to thoroughly reheat any dish with rice, as leftover rice can grow a bacteria that causes foodborne illness (even when it's stored in the fridge). Add a few drops of water to keep the rice moist, then reheat it in the oven or microwave to a piping hot temperature (or at least 165 degrees F). Use a food thermometer to ensure it has reached the proper temperature. This cozy casserole freezes well. If you plan to freeze it, cook the recipe in an aluminum pan. Let the casserole cool completely, then cover it with a layer of storage wrap and a layer of aluminum foil. Store in the freezer for up to three months. Thaw in the fridge overnight, then reheat in the oven or microwave. ""This is an outstanding casserole,"" raves Paula.

962,Chicken Parmesan,4.8,"(4,432)","3,095",15 mins,20 mins,45 mins,4,4 servings,"Chicken Parmesan is no doubt the most popular non-pasta dish in Italian-American style restaurants. And while this delicious meal may seem fancy, it's actually pretty easy to make at home. In fact, chicken Parmesan is one of those meals that's often best made in your own kitchen. The main problem I have with most versions of Chicken Parmesan served in restaurants is that they drown the chicken in so much sauce and cheese that it ends up being a big soggy clump of chicken and cheese. But it doesn't have to be that way, not with this method. Unlike many restaurant preparations, this method doesn't overwhelm the chicken with sauce and cheese. The key to great non-soggy chicken Parmesan? Don't put any sauce under the chicken cutlets, just a little bit of sauce on top, so the breading stays relatively crisp. If you like a lot of sauce on your chicken Parmesan, that's fine, you can always serve extra sauce on the side. I also use some actual Parmesan cheese in this recipe! Curiously, most versions of chicken Parmesan only use mozzarella. Here, I'm going with a delicious mixture of fresh mozzarella, tangy Provolone and real Parmesan. Another little trick I employ here is to add some grated Parmesan to the breadcrumbs, which adds another layer of flavor. You'll fry the breadcrumb and Parmesan crusted chicken breasts just to golden brown before transferring them to a baking pan and adding sauce (but not too much!), cheese, and herbs. Okay, now let's break it down. Before we get to the recipe, here's your cheat sheet for making the best baked chicken Parmesan: 1. Pound chicken to an even thicknessPound the boneless chicken breasts out to an even width so they cook evenly. Basically, you're pounding the thick part down to the size of the thin part, about a half-inch thick. 2. Don't skimp on seasoningSalt and pepper the chicken well. Then don't bother with salting the flour and bread crumbs. 3. Add Parmesan to the bread crumbs Use Panko bread crumbs mixed with a little finely grated Parmesan cheese. When you fry the breaded chicken, the Parmesan will give it an extra crunch and exciting flavor. 4. Rest before cookingBefore frying, let the breaded chicken sit on the counter for about 15 minutes to allow the coating to adhere to the chicken breast. 5. Go easy on the sauce THE KEY: Don't drown the poor breaded and fried chicken in sauce and smother it in cheese. Too much of a good thing is too much. You did all the work creating a crisp coating, why make it soggy with too much sauce and cheese? 6. Make sure your oven is hot, hot, hot Be sure your oven is completely preheated to 450 F. You'll want the cheese to brown slightly and the breading to crisp up before the chicken gets overcooked, and a nice hot oven is the way to go. Now find out the best wine to pair with your non-soggy, not-too-saucy baked chicken Parmesan. Enjoy! ""Perfectly delicious and beautiful just as instructed!"" says angie. ""As the video explains, too much sauce and/or cheese only takes away from the flavor — I learned this by experience. I suggest having additional sauce and/or cheese available if guests choose to add more on their plate, but personally think less is more in this case."" ""This recipe delivers!"" raves deneice knotts. ""This was SO easy. My chicken was juicy and crunchy plus the cheesy goodness. YUM!! My son said this 'slaps,' which means it's one of the best things he has ever tasted. Thanks! I'll make this again without being afraid of dry chicken."" ""A wonder of wonders!"" raves Joe. ""Watch the vid! Chef John has some cost-effective tips on flouring your chicken. As well as seasoning the chicken, instead of the flour, eggs, and panko. You will never do it any other way again.

967,Spicy Thai Basil Chicken (Pad Krapow Gai),4.8,"(1,118)",774,15 mins,10 mins,25 mins,2,2 servings,"Allrecipes home cooks give a solid 5-star rating to Chef John's easy-to-make version of Thai basil chicken (pad krapow gai), a popular Thai restaurant-worthy dish that's ready in less than 30 minutes. In his easy and accessible style, Chef John walks you through the recipe ingredients and shows you how to build layers of flavor using simple cooking techniques. ""I don't cook Thai food at home often, mostly because there are at least a dozen such restaurants within walking distance, but when I do, there's nothing I enjoy more than this spicy Thai basil chicken,"" says Chef John. Thai basil chicken is a stir-fry dish made with finely chopped or ground chicken cooked with chile peppers, garlic, and shallots, and seasoned with a sweet and salty sauce and finished with fresh basil. It's a classic dish in Thai cuisine and can be found in restaurants and as a popular street food. SauceChicken broth, oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, white sugar, and brown sugar are whisked together to make a sweet and salty mixture to flavor the recipe. ChickenChef John minces skinless, boneless chicken thigh until they're very finely chopped. You could use packaged ground chicken to speed up the process, but chopping or grinding your own gives you superior flavor and texture. Shallots and garlicSliced shallots and minced garlic add another layer of flavor. Hot chile peppersThis is where the heat comes into play. Use Thai chile, serrano chile, or other hot pepper of your choice, and customize the amount to suit your tolerance for heat. BasilThis recipe traditionally uses Thai basil or ""holy"" basil, which have their own distinctive flavors. Chef John uses sweet basil, which is more readily available in most grocery stores. In the recipe video, Chef John demonstrates how he stacks and rolls basil leaves like a cigar to quickly slice thin ribbons that cook faster and impart flavor throughout the dish. ""No, I didn't use the real ""holy"" basil,"" says Chef John. ""But even with regular basil, this simple recipe is spectacular. Aromatic basil is the perfect herb for pairing with the slightly sweet, sort of salty, and possibly spicy, chopped meat."" There are more than 100 varieties of basil, all of which are members of the mint family, and each variety has its own flavor. Thai basil has a mildly spicy licorice or anise seed flavor. Sweet basil (also known as Italian basil) tastes sweet and peppery. Holy basil (also called Thai holy basil) tastes of pepper and cloves. Read more: What's the Difference Between Thai Basil, Sweet Basil, and Holy Basil? Chef John recommends you prep all the ingredients before you start cooking because once you start the stir-fry, it all comes together very quickly. Prep takes about 15 minutes and cooking time is a speedy 10 minutes. If you want to serve the chicken with steamed rice, time your cooking accordingly. To get started, you'll add the oil and minced chicken to a smoking-hot skillet and cook the chicken briefly for a couple of minutes. Next, you'll add the shallots, garlic, and sliced chilies, and cook for another couple of minutes. About a tablespoon of the sauce goes in next to cook for a minute with the chicken until it starts to caramelize on the skillet. Finally, you add the rest of the sauce, scraping up the caramelization and coating the chicken for another minute. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the basil until it's wilted from the residual heat. Now your Thai Basil Chicken is ready to serve. ""Amazing taste and for sure cheaper than buying it in a Thai restaurant,"" says Allrecipes home cook Seora Juarez. ""As suggested, go to a local Asian market to get your basil. It's a more authentic taste, but I've tried it with regular basil and it tastes good too. I like mine hot so I finely chop the peppers to make it spicy."" ""Amazing rendition of the classic Thai dish. I tend to use extra garlic and shallots. I use serrano chilies because traditional Thai chilies involve an extra grocery store. Otherwise make as directed. Perfect for family meals when I have the time to cook, and my kids love it,"" says reviewer Blair Dunn. Allrecipes community member outdoorsgirl says, ""I love Thai food and do a lot of cooking. Kudos to Chef John for taking a Thai recipe and simplifying it so the average person can make a great dish! Substituting sweet soya instead of the regular soya and sugar works good too. The trick is a very hot wok ( hopefully) or skillet.""

You can add or substitute chicken salad ingredients to suit your preferences, and it's genius at using up leftovers. I'll show you how to make tasty chicken salad using this top-rated recipe for Basic Chicken Salad, and share plenty of tips and ideas along the way. This recipe for Basic Chicken Salad uses six simple ingredients and takes only 10 minutes to make from start to finish. After that, you can serve it up on salad greens, scoop it into pita bread or half an avocado, roll it up in a tortilla for a wrap, or serve it hot in a quesadilla or chicken melt. ChickenCooked chicken: chopped or shredded. If you have leftover roast chicken, grilled chicken, or rotisserie chicken, chicken salad is a great way to use it all up. You can also use canned chicken to make chicken salad (drain it first), or you can cook chicken for chicken salad. Use white or dark meat, or a combination of both if you prefer. MayonnaiseCreamy mayonnaise binds together all the separate ingredients for chicken salad into a satisfying mixture of flavors and textures. Use your choice of regular or reduced fat mayonnaise. In this chicken salad recipe, the mayonnaise is enhanced with a tablespoon of lemon juice for brightness and a ¼ teaspoon of ground black pepper. Taste the dressing before mixing it with the chicken; you may find it needs a little salt or other flavor-booster from your spice collection.

Store chicken salad in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Stored properly, chicken salad should last for three to five days.

Olive OilOlive oil provides moisture and prevents the chicken breasts from drying out. It also helps the chicken cook more evenly. SaltUse your favorite coarse sea salt for the most delicious results. Creole SeasoningCreole seasoning adds flavor and a bit of welcome heat. Chicken BrothYou'll use chicken broth to make an easy pan sauce to pour over the baked chicken. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's what you can expect when you make these simple baked chicken breasts: Coat the chicken breasts with olive oil, then sprinkle both sides with salt and Creole seasoning. Place the seasoned chicken in a broiler pan. Bake in an oven for about 10 minutes, then flip and continue to bake for about 15 more minutes (or until the juices run clear). When the chicken is done baking, transfer it to a plate. Pour the chicken broth into the pan you used to bake the chicken. Scrape any browned bits off the side with a spatula. Drizzle the pan sauce over the baked chicken before serving. It depends on the size of the chicken breasts. Smaller chicken breasts will bake in a shorter amount of time, while larger breasts will take a bit longer. If you use the 5-ounce breasts the recipe calls for, the chicken should be ready after about 25 minutes in the pre-heated oven. When the chicken is done, the juices will run clear and an instant read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F.

Have some rice on deck because you won't be able to resist the temptation of immediately biting into this sweet and sticky chicken. Orange chicken is a popular item at Chinese restaurants. It consists of small cubes of chicken that are breaded, pan-fried, and coated in an orange sauce. The orange sauce is sweet with a little tang and a hint of spice. It's mainly known for its orange flavor (as you can guess from the name). It's typically made with orange juice and orange zest to achieve the citrus flavor. Even though you see orange chicken at Chinese restaurants in America, it's not a typical Chinese dish. Instead, it was popularized by American Chinese restaurants — alongside General Tso's chicken, which is also not traditional Chinese food. You'll find the full step-by-step recipe below, but here's what you can expect when making orange chicken: Combine all sauce ingredients in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then let cool. Once cool, transfer to a zip-top bag with chicken and place in the refrigerator to marinate for at least 2 hours. After the chicken is marinated, coat it in flour, salt, and pepper. Cook it in a skillet until it's brown on both sides. Add the sauce to an empty skillet and bring it to a boil. Add cornstarch and water (to thicken it), then the chicken pieces. Let it simmer until everything is combined. Store orange chicken in an airtight container in the fridge for three to five days. Reheat the chicken in a skillet — you may need to add water to fix the sauce's consistency. Freeze orange chicken in an airtight container or zip-top freezer bag for up to three months. Let thaw in the refrigerator overnight. ""I made this for my family and got raves. I didn't have any green onions so I left onion out and I cut back a little bit on the red pepper flakes.

979,Mom's Fabulous Chicken Pot Pie with Biscuit Crust,4.7,(820),656,20 mins,40 mins,1 hrs 10 mins,8,1 7x11-inch pot pie,"Hearty chicken pot pie is the ultimate comfort food. From the doughy biscuits down to the creamy chicken filling, pot pie is a family-favorite dinner. When you need a quick pot pie fix that doesn't require an actual pie crust, look to this recipe that uses store-bought shortcuts — like biscuit dough and rotisserie chicken — to make prep even easier. Here's what you'll need to make easy chicken pot pie with biscuits: ChickenUse store-bought rotisserie chicken or leftover cooked chicken for easy prep. Flaky-Style BiscuitsUse a can of your favorite biscuit dough. VegetablesThis pot pie is loaded with onions, celery, carrots, and peas. ButterSauté the vegetables in butter for extra flavor. Chicken BrothThis recipe calls for low-sodium chicken broth, but you can use any chicken broth you have on hand. Half-and-Half CreamHalf-and-half gives the filling its creamy texture. FlourFlour will coat the vegetables for a light fry, plus thicken the filling up. SpicesThis recipe calls for parsley, thyme, salt, and pepper. Egg YolkYou only need an egg yolk for an egg wash, so save the egg white for another recipe. You'll find the full instructions for this simple recipe below, but here's what you can expect: Cook the onion, celery, and carrots in a skillet with butter until tender. Stir in the peas, spices, and flour. Add the chicken broth and cream to the skillet. Cook until the sauce thickens, then add the chicken. Transfer the chicken pot pie filling to a baking dish and top with the biscuit dough. Brush the biscuits with an egg-water wash. Bake the pot pie until the biscuits are golden brown and the chicken filling is hot and bubbling. Because this recipe already calls for flour, your pot pie filling should be a great consistency. However, if you're having trouble getting the filling to thicken, you can simmer the sauce for a little bit longer. If that doesn't work (or if it's taking too long), you can also add a cornstarch slurry to the filling. Chicken pot pie with biscuits is a pretty hearty and heavy meal. It already has a nice balance of vegetables, protein, and carbs. But if you can't have dinner without a side, we suggest pairing it with a light salad to brighten up the savory flavors. Store the leftover biscuits and leftover chicken pot pie filling separately (so the biscuits don't get soggy). Place the biscuits in a zip-top bag and store in the refrigerator. Place chicken pot pie filling in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to four days. When you're ready to reheat, add the biscuits back on top. Then reheat in a skillet or in the oven. Yes, you can! Freeze the filling and biscuits separately or freeze the entire pot pie together. To freeze it separately: Store the cooked biscuits in a zip-top bag and pot pie filling in an airtight container or zip-top bag in the freezer for up to three months. Defrost in the fridge overnight, then assemble the pot pie before baking. To freeze together: Store the chicken pot pie with biscuits in an airtight container in the freezer for up to three months. Thaw in the fridge overnight. ""​​Very tasty and versatile. Use what you have! Hubby loved it and wants it in his lunch for work this week.

You can easily make a gourmet restaurant-worthy meal in the comfort of your own kitchen with this top-rated chicken cordon bleu recipe. It's impressive, delicious, and way simpler than you think. A cordon bleu is a dish that traditionally consists of meat wrapped around cheese, then breaded and pan-fried or deep-fried. Many modern versions of the classic French recipe, such as this one, are baked. Classic chicken cordon bleu is made with the following ingredients: chicken cutlets, cooked ham, Swiss cheese, bread crumbs, and simple spices. It's usually topped with a rich cream sauce spiked with a hint of Dijon mustard. ""Cordon bleu"" translates to ""blue ribbon."" According to Larousse Gastronomique, a French food encyclopedia, the phrase dates back to medieval times when the most prestigious order a knight could earn was called the Cross of the Holy Spirit. The honor was signified by a medal that hung from a blue ribbon known as Le Cordon Bleu. Over time, the blue ribbon became a symbol of excellence. The term, meanwhile, became associated with food that meets the highest of standards or that is prepared by the most prestigious chefs. There are many ways to make chicken cordon bleu, from the traditional French method to the simple oven-baked one detailed here. You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect: Cover the chicken cutlets with plastic wrap and pound them with a mallet to create thin, even pieces. Thoroughly season the chicken with salt and pepper. Top each piece of chicken with one slice of Swiss cheese and one slice of ham. Roll the chicken vertically so that the ham and cheese are contained. Secure each roll with a toothpick. Arrange the chicken rolls in a prepared baking dish. Sprinkle liberally and evenly with breadcrumbs. Bake until the chicken is no longer pink, top each roll with half a slice of Swiss, and continue baking until the cheese is melted. This recipe should be fully cooked after 30-35 minutes in an oven preheated to 350 degrees F. However, every oven is different — the chicken should no longer be pink and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Chicken cordon bleu is traditionally topped with a decadent cream sauce made with Parmesan cheese and Dijon mustard — you can improvise your own recipe or try spiking our top-rated Alfredo Sauce with a hint of Dijon.

Reheat in the oven instead of the microwave to avoid sogginess. About 10 minutes at 350 degrees F should do the trick. To freeze chicken cordon bleu, simply arrange the completely-cooled rolls on a lined baking sheet, cover, and freeze for about two hours. Transfer the now-frozen rolls to an airtight freezer bag labeled with the date. Freeze for up to four months. To thaw frozen chicken cordon bleu, transfer the container to the fridge the night before you plan to serve it. Bake the thawed rolls for about 10 minutes at 350 degrees F. ""What a wonderful recipe,"" raves Pj kearns. ""Simple and delicious! I did use a little olive oil to roll the chicken in after it was constructed and then lightly breaded them.

990,Easy Paella,4.6,(620),446,30 mins,30 mins,1 hrs,8,,"When you're in need of a hearty meal that's delicious and easy to make, turn to paella: The ultimate one-pot Spanish comfort food. This flavorful rice dish is ready in just an hour. Plus, it'll have your mouth watering the entire time it's cooking thanks to its aromatic ingredients. Trust us, you're going to want to save this recipe! Paella is a flavorful and versatile rice dish that originated in Valencia, Spain. It's traditionally made with rice, meat, seafood, beans, vegetables, and aromatic spices. Learn more: What Is Paella and How Do You Make It At Home? Because paella is so versatile, almost every chef has their own recipe. Here's what you can expect to find in this Easy Paella. ChickenThis recipe calls for chicken breasts, but you can use any cut of chicken you like. Some reviewers choose chicken legs or thighs. ChorizoChorizo will add a little kick to the paella. If you're in a pinch, you can use cubes of cured chorizo to save some prep time. ShrimpBuy pre-peeled and deveined shrimp to save on prep time. RiceOf course, the major ingredient in paella is rice. Any Spanish or short-grain rice will work. VegetablesThis paella has a Spanish onion and red bell pepper. Some reviewers like to add more bell pepper, or even peas. Chicken StockTo keep the paella from drying out, add chicken stock. SpicesPaella is super flavorful thanks to the saffron, bay leaf, Italian parsley, garlic, red pepper flakes, lemon zest, oregano, paprika, salt, and pepper in the dish. Spanish rice, or bomba rice, is the most common rice used in paella. However, any short-grain white rice, or even medium-grain white rice, will work. You'll find the fully detailed recipe below, but here's what you can expect from this Easy Paella recipe. Allow the chicken to marinate in olive oil, paprika, oregano, salt, and pepper in the fridge for a few hours (or overnight). Heat olive oil in a paella pan and stir in garlic, red pepper flakes, and rice. Add saffron, bay leaf, parsley, chicken stock, and lemon zest. Simmer rice for 20 minutes. Cook chicken, onion, bell pepper, chorizo, and shrimp until done. Then add to the rice mixture. Not necessarily. Even though a paella pan is designed specifically for making paella (obviously), you don't need one to make a great paella. A paella pan is wide and shallow, which is helpful to create a nice crust on the paella. But if you don't have the special pan, you can use any wide and shallow skillet. Store leftover (completely cooled) paella in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. After that, the seafood may be at risk of going bad. Reheat paella in a paella pan or skillet on the stove for the best results. What does culinary producer Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. Nicole McMom) love about paella? ""I love this for entertaining because you serve it straight from the dish — and it's actually quite an affordable way to feed a lot of people."" Here are a few of her best tips and tricks for making this one-pot wonder: · As the main ingredient, rice is key to a great paella. Don't rinse it before adding it to the other ingredients! Keep it as starchy as possible.· The beauty of paella is that all the flavors build upon one another as the dish comes together in one pan. Let the meat render fully so the flavorful fat coats the grains of rice.· Paella can be as extravagant or as budget-friendly as you want it to be. Keep it simple with chicken and sausage or incorporate mussels, scallops, calamari, and more.· Once everything is assembled, avoid stirring it too much. Excessive stirring will create a creamy risotto — we're after a more pilaf-like texture. ""Other than adding more chicken and omitting the shrimp, I followed the directions exactly. I think this is the best thing I've ever cooked. My family enjoyed it. I was told repeatedly how good it was. I would suggest ANYONE to cook this, it is easy and you feel accomplished after crafting such a delicious meal,"" says My soul cleaveth unto the dust. ""I made this even easier by using prepackaged saffron rice instead of making my own. I recommend cooking the chorizo separately and draining it before adding it to the mix. I also cooked the shrimp separately and added it at the end, since I think some of the shrimp tends to get overcooked if you have it in a large pot with many other items. I made this for my husband's birthday dinner, with a few tapas as appetizers, and it was wonderful,"" according to Sara. ""This was my first time making paella, and I hoped that it would be as good as all the reviews from others who have made it. It. was. wonderful! This recipe is going to be a keeper, the husband had two bowls, and has said, 'This is great!' six times, and it's only been 20 minutes since I served it,"" raves Kansas Cook.

You'll never be disappointed by dry or not-hot-enough wings ever again! You'll find the full step-by-step instructions below, but here's what you can expect from this hot wings recipe: 1. Coat with flour: Coat the chicken wings with a mixture of flour, paprika, cayenne pepper, and salt. Refrigerate coated wings for at least an hour.2. Make the sauce: In a saucepan on the stove, combine butter, hot sauce, pepper, and garlic. Stir until butter is melted, then remove from heat and reserve for later.3. Fry the wings: Fry the chicken wings in a skillet filled with oil heated to 375 degrees F. Remove the wings and place them on a paper-towel lined plate to remove the excess oil.4. Coat the wings: Drizzle the hot wings sauce over the fried wings or place the hot wings in a bowl with the sauce and mix together until combined. ""There ain't no thing like a chicken wing,"" according to culinary expert Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. NicoleMcMom). ""And there's no reason you should be making them at home."" We couldn't have said it better ourselves. Here are a few of Nicole's top hot wing tips and tricks: · The most budget-friendly way to make hot wings is to purchase whole chicken wings, then break them down into drumettes and flats yourself. Of course, you can buy them pre-cut if you're short on time or patience.· You can keep the sauce simple or make it your own with additional ingredients. Throw in some extra vinegar if you like your wings tangy or some honey if you're craving something spicy-sweet, recommends Nicole.· Don't try to fry too many wings at once. If you crowd the oil, Nicole says, you run the risk of bringing the temperature down.· Make sure the fried wings are fully tossed — don't just drizzle the sauce over them. Nicole likes to make a double-batch of sauce so she can ensure each wing is fully coated. Buffalo wings are delicious served with a side of ranch or blue cheese and cooling veggies (like celery or carrots). You can also serve hot wings as an appetizer for pizza or alongside mac and cheese (bonus points if you mix the hot wing sauce into the mac and cheese). Store hot wings in an airtight container in the fridge for up to four days. For best results, reheat leftover hot wings in the oven or air fryer — this will ensure they stay crispy. Freeze your hot wings so you'll have easy appetizers or dinners on hand at all times. Place hot wings in an airtight container or zip-top freezer bag and freeze for up to three months. ""Great wings!

1002,Yummy Honey Chicken Kabobs,4.7,"(3,074)","2,043",15 mins,15 mins,2 hrs 30 mins,12,,"Make restaurant-worthy chicken kebabs at home with this top-rated recipe. These sweet-savory chicken kebabs are beloved by the Allrecipes community for a few reasons: They're easy to assemble and grill, they're super versatile, and (most importantly) they're absolutely irresistible. This top-rated recipe features a sweet and savory marinade made with just four ingredients: honey, soy sauce, vegetable oil, and ground black pepper. We love it for its simplicity, but also because it ensures juicy and flavorful chicken kebabs every time. So what will you need besides the homemade marinade? Here's what else to put on your grocery list: ChickenCut boneless, skinless chicken breast halves into 1-inch cubes. OnionYou can use any onion variety you want — red, white, or sweet — depending on your flavor preferences. Cut the onion into 2-inch pieces. Bell PeppersThis chicken kebab recipe calls for two red bell peppers cut into 2-inch pieces. You can also use yellow or green peppers. GarlicYou'll add two cloves of fresh garlic to the marinade with the other ingredients. SkewersYou can usually find bamboo skewers in the grilling aisle at your grocery store. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's what you can expect when you make these top-rated chicken kebabs: Whisk together the honey, soy sauce, oil, and black pepper in a large bowl. Transfer ¼-cup of the marinade to a small jar and seal. Add the chicken, onions, peppers, and garlic to the marinade in the bowl. Cover and refrigerate for at least two hours, but preferably overnight. Drain the chicken and vegetables, then discard the marinade. Thread the ingredients onto the skewers. Grill the skewers on a lightly oiled, preheated grate. Cook, turning frequently and brushing with reserved marinade, until the chicken is fully cooked and no longer pink in the center. Culinary producer Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. NicoleMcMom) loves a good chicken kebab. Not only are they delicious, they're a great way to stretch a few chicken breasts into a hearty meal that'll serve a crowd. Here are a few of her favorite kebab grilling tips and tricks: · Try your best to cut all the ingredients in roughly the same size and shape so they cook evenly.· If you're using wooden skewers, don't forget to soak them for at least 30 minutes. If dry skewers don't catch on fire (and they might), they'll likely char too much or become too brittle to support the ingredients.· One of Nicole's favorite hacks? Use two skewers for each kebab instead of just one — this will keep them from rolling around the grill and it'll make serving a breeze. Store your leftover chicken kebabs in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to four days. Reheat in the microwave or oven until the chicken is warmed through. Yes, you can freeze chicken kebabs! But you'll have better results if you freeze the kebabs before you grill them. To freeze uncooked chicken kebabs: Follow the recipe until the final step (don't grill the assembled kebabs). Arrange the kebabs in a single layer on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover and flash freeze for at least three hours. Transfer the now-frozen kebabs to a freezer-safe container and freeze for up to three months. Grill the chicken kebabs from frozen. ""Wow,"" raves SILLYSARAHC123. ""This was awesome! I got so many compliments on this recipe - everyone said they were the best kabobs they had ever had.

The best way to reheat lasagna is in the oven. Simply cover the leftovers with foil and bake at 350 degrees F for about half an hour, or until it's heated through and the sauce is bubbly. If you're planning to freeze lasagna, it's best to cook it in a foil baking dish. Allow the casserole to cool, then cover the whole thing in at least one layer of storage wrap.

This simple, foolproof ""mathematical method"" for making the very best prime rib will greatly increase your chances of success. Here is the formula: Multiply the exact weight times 5 minutes. For me it was 5.35 x 5 = 26.75 minutes, which we round up to 27. You'll cook your room-temperature prime rib at 500 degrees F for exactly that many minutes. (Twenty-seven minutes, in my case.) Then turn off the oven and wait 2 hours without opening the door. When the time's up, remove the prime rib and slice into the most perfectly medium-rare meat you've ever seen. See? That's all it takes to make foolproof prime rib cooked to a perfect pink that's somewhere just a shade under medium rare. Just make sure you're starting with a prime rib that has been brought to room temperature! This is critical in order for the math to work!Now, while the method could not be easier, there are a couple things that this method requires: a full-size, modern oven with a digital temperature setting that indicates when it is preheated. Older ovens with manual controls can vary greatly, and the doors may not have the proper insulation. Here's another pro tip for you: Because prime rib is expensive, you should always insert a probe-style thermometer to monitor the internal temp of your roast and avoid any chance of over-cooking. Set the probe alarm (125 F for medium-rare) just in case, and pull the prime rib from oven even if there's still time left on the oven timer. Serve your prime rib with Chef John's Beef Au Jus. Enjoy! ""This is a fool proof method for making the best medium rare prime rib,"" says Haiku. ""Your seasonings can be changed according to your preference, but what's listed works perfectly. It's the cooking method that is the key. It cannot be stressed enough, the roast MUST be at room temperature in order for this to work. If it is the least bit cold in the middle of the roast, you will come out with a very rare roast. A mistake I only made once because I was worried about leaving it out to get warm. Don't worry! It will be fine! I usually purchase 4.5-to-5 pound roasts and take it out of the fridge for a minimum of 5 hours to be sure it is room temp. It comes out absolutely PERFECT and juicy every time."" ""I have used this recipe for years and it works perfectly,"" says Nancy. ""ONE THING that will cause the meat to be less than medium rare, besides not having the rib at room temperature, is the fan in newer ovens! I had no issue for many years until I got a new oven. Many new ovens have a fan that comes on when you turn the oven off. It quickly lowers the temp, which, obviously, will not work for this recipe. Since I have a built-in oven, I actually shut off the breaker to the oven so the fan doesn't come on. Otherwise you can just unplug it.""""Absolutely the easiest way to make perfect prime rib every time,"" raves Claudia B. ""But do not be tempted to open up the oven door until time is up!""

Historically, cabbage was paired with pork bacon in Ireland. Irish immigrants in 19th-century New York City, who often lived in the same neighborhood as Jewish butchers, noticed flavor similarities between the corned beef of NYC delicatessens and the pork bacon of their homeland. Thus, corned beef and cabbage was born. These days, it's commonly associated with St. Patrick's Day. Corned beef and pastrami are both deli staples, but they're not the same thing. Corned beef is salt-cured beef that is cooked by boiling, while pastrami is seasoned and smoked beef. Place corned beef and seasoning packet in a Dutch oven, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook until the meat is tender. In the meantime, cut the red potatoes in half and cut the cabbage into wedges. Peel and cut the carrots.

1026,Cast Iron Pan-Seared Steak (Oven-Finished),4.5,(45),36,5 mins,13 mins,1 hrs 23 mins,2,2 steaks,"If you're making steaks inside, you've come to the right place. This technique for cooking steak in a cast iron skillet is unbeatable. What sets it apart? It starts on the stove in a cast iron skillet, but you'll finish the steak in the oven. The stovetop-to-oven method produces steaks with a deeply caramelized crust and a tender, perfectly cooked interior. We love this oven-finished steak recipe for a lot of reasons. To name a few: The skillet is the star of the show. Why? Cast iron absorbs and retains heat like no other surface. It heats up fast and cooks evenly. A hot cast iron skillet puts a quick sear on steaks, creating a beautiful caramelized crust, without overcooking the center of the steak. Also, the cast iron skillet goes from stovetop to oven with ease. This recipe calls for beef top-sirloin steaks. Choose steaks that are at least 1-inch thick. If the steak is too thin, the inside will overcook before the beautiful caramelized crust can form on the outside. Of course, this stovetop-to-oven technique works well for more expensive cuts, too. Allrecipes community member Ken Turnbull loves the technique for thick steaks with nice marbling: ""I learned this method from a good steak house almost 50 years ago and always have the best results,"" he says. This simple steak recipe calls for marinating your top-sirloin steaks in a simple marinade made up of common ingredients you likely have on hand: Orange juice, cider vinegar, olive oil, and Worcestershire sauce. The ideal steak marinades are simple mixtures of acid (OJ and cider), fat (olive oil), and seasonings (Worcestershire sauce). The acid tenderizes the meat and delivers a tangy flavor foundation; the fat binds the marinade and helps prevent steaks from sticking; and the seasonings, well, they add flavor. Let the steaks sit for 5 to 10 minutes before serving to allow the juices to redistribute. As your steaks rest, they will also continue to cook slightly. For best results, use a meat thermometer to test for doneness. Here is what you're aiming for: Rare: 125 degrees F (52 degrees C)Medium Rare: 130 degrees F (54 degrees C)Medium: 140 degrees F (60 degrees C)Medium Well: 150 degrees F (65 degrees C)Well Done: 160 degrees F (70 degrees C) ""The outside had a perfect crust and inside it was extremely juicy and tender,"" says Jeffrey Klotzbach. ""I would recommend it to anyone."" ""A 1-inch thick steak is as thin as you want to go,"" says Ken Turnbull. ""For medium rare, I find that between 1 and 2 minutes per side is all that is needed for the sear and that 5 minutes in a 425 degree oven is enough, if not too much, for a 1-inch steak.""

1027,Best Meatloaf,4.5,"(1,028)",828,15 mins,1 hrs 10 mins,1 hrs 25 mins,12,1 meatloaf,"Good old-fashioned meatloaf stands alongside hot dogs and apple pie as iconic American foods. That's not to say any of those dishes actually originated in America, but that hasn't stopped us from embedding them deeply into our culture and lore, and making them our own. Meatloaf especially is a product of ingenuity and making-do as thrifty, waste-not home cooks combine low-cost ingredients to make a satisfying main dish that will stretch ingredients and feed a family. Yet, as a highly customizable recipe, meatloaf can be found everywhere from classic diners to high-end restaurants, to everyday dinner tables. Meatloaf recipes are typically made of ground meats mixed with vegetables, seasonings, and crushed crackers or fine breadcrumbs, and are held together with a binder; usually an egg or two. This top-rated recipe for Best Meatloaf demonstrates how to make a meatloaf using the most simple ingredients and tried-and-tested techniques: Meat mixtureThis recipe for Best Meatloaf uses extra-lean ground beef, which means the fat-to-meat ratio is about 4 percent fat to 96 percent lean. The low ratio of fat results in a meatloaf with minimal grease. But since fat carries flavor, you'll want to add some back to keep blandness at bay. By adding a touch of sour cream to the mixture, this recipe benefits from that little extra fat plus a hint of tangy flavor at the same time. Note: adding milk is optional and may only be necessary if you're cooking at higher altitudes. Sautéed vegetablesCooking minced aromatics (a fancy term for the onion and garlic) in butter before adding it to the meat mixture mellows the flavors and ensures you won't bite into the sharp taste of onion and garlic. Flavor boostersThere's nothing shy about the taste of Worcestershire sauce, and adding it to the mix along with tomato sauce brings sweet and savory flavor to every bite. A top glaze of tomato sauce and ketchup creates a delectable sauce to finish the dish. Baking techniqueHow long to cook meatloaf depends on the size of the loaf and the temperature of the oven. Ideally, you want to fully cook the inside to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). This recipe for Best Meatloaf gives you a clever 3-step approach: You'll bake the meatloaf for 40 minutes at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) to fully cook the inside, and then increase the heat to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 15 minutes to give the outside a tasty crust. Finally, you'll brush the meatloaf with tomato sauce and ketchup, and bake it for 10 more minutes to caramelize the glaze. Don't overwork the mixCombine the ingredients until they just come together, otherwise you'll end up with a dense, compacted meatloaf. Think smallI'm talking about the size of the solid add-ins. Cut the onions and garlic (or any other vegetables you might add) into very small, uniform pieces before sautéeing them. Crush the crackers and crumble the breadcrumbs until they're very fine. This helps make a more uniform meatloaf texture. Let it rest before slicingJust like with any roasted meat, meatloaf needs to sit for a bit (about 10 minutes) so it can reabsorb the juices before you slice and serve.

I didn't have a meat thermometer, but the timing was perfect! My husband took one bite and said it tasted like his mom's! I think next time I will use half ground sirloin and half ground pork as another suggested..."" ""I made this tonight for my family and it was a great meatloaf! The only thing I changed on this recipe was I used ground turkey instead of ground beef. Anyway...this turkey meatloaf was absolutely fantastic! Oh yeah...one other thing I did was use a cup of seasoned bread crumbs instead of the sliced bread. My whole family said this was 'the best meatloaf I have ever made.'"" —JoJo Mandy says, ""My husband and I (who are NOT big meatloaf fans) loved the heck out of this recipe.

1028,Quick Beef Stir-Fry,4.4,(393),262,15 mins,10 mins,25 mins,4,4 servings,"Need to use up some of your leftover vegetables and other pantry staple ingredients? Look no further than a classic beef stir-fry. This beef and broccoli stir-fry comes together in just 25 minutes and only requires ingredients that you probably already have. And if you don't? You can just skip them! This dish is packed with veggies, beef, and saucy flavors for a weeknight dinner warrior that checks all the boxes. Served with rice or lo mein noodles, this will be the best beef stir-fry you've ever made. The most time-consuming part of making stir-fry is all the chopping. Slicing your meat and veggies into smaller bite-sized pieces can take a little bit of time and effort, but it's worth it for the end result. After you've chopped all your ingredients, you'll cook the beef on one side of the wok, or another large frying pan, and the veggies on the other side of the wok. Once they're all cooked, you can mix the two sides together and add the soy sauce and sesame seeds. Some stir-fry recipes use a specific stir-fry sauce, which can be as basic as broth, soy sauce, sugar, and rice wine vinegar. This quick stir-fry calls for only soy sauce. But you can feel free to add a stir-fry sauce or marinate your beef in one if you prefer. Learn more: How to Make the Easiest Stir-Fry Ever Flank steaks are the most popular choice for making a stir-fry. However, you can also use sirloin steak, skirt steak, Denver steak, or even beef chuck. Beef chuck steak is the most economical choice, but it does require some extra trimming. You'll want to remove the tough tissue from the steaks before frying. If possible, you should use a wok to make beef stir-fry. Woks are large and have sloping sides that let you cook the entire stir-fry in one pan, so you can easily stir and flip the food without fear of it flying out. They also are designed to cook foods quicker than skillets and with less oil. If you can't use a wok (or another carbon steel pan) then any skillet will work. You may just need to cook the meat and veggies in separate batches. When cooking, make sure you heat the pan and oil up first before adding your ingredients — they should sizzle as soon as they hit the heat. And always use an oil with a high smoke point, like canola or peanut oil, for the best stir-fry results. ""I added this recipe to my favorites list not even a month ago and I have made this, using different variations every time, at least 5 times. My family loves this recipe and I've paired it with rice or noodles and it always pleases. I usually use beef stew meat and switch up the vegetables. I would definitely recommend this recipe for anybody that's pressed for time and wants to make a quick easy meal that the whole family will enjoy,"" says Tiana Marie Ginorio. ""Hubby and I both liked this. It's very easy to make and is ready in no time. I used flank steak instead of sirloin and I didn't have any green onions, but otherwise I followed the recipe as written. We both though it needed a bit of something, so after the first few bites we added some crushed chilis for a bit of heat,"" adds Allrecipes Allstar France C. ""Made it true to the recipe except that I only used half of a red bell pepper because it was what I had. The dish didn't suffer at all for it and the spiciness was just right for me.

This simple ground beef stroganoff comes together in 20 minutes with just six ingredients. Beef stroganoff is an iconic Russian dish that consists of beef in a creamy sauce. According to legend, it was created by chefs who worked for the Stroganov family in the 1800s. The dish is often made with mushrooms and served over rice or egg noodles. Traditional beef stroganoff is made with steak, a roux-based sauce, and sauteed mushrooms. But, as the title suggests, this recipe is simplified. It relies on shortcut ingredients, such as ground beef and canned cream of mushroom soup, to keep the cook time down and to cut down on extra steps. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what can you can expect when you make this ground beef stroganoff: Saute ground beef until brown, then drain the fat. Add the canned soup and garlic powder. Simmer for about 10 minutes, then remove from heat. Stir cooked egg noodles and sour cream into the meat mixture. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Since this ground beef stroganoff is a rather heavy dish, you may not need a side dish at all. A simple side salad, though, is a great way to round out your meal and to add a pop of color. Of course, if you want something a little different, you could leave out the egg noodles and serve the ground beef and sauce mixture over white rice or mashed potatoes. Store leftover beef stroganoff in an airtight container in the fridge for up to four days. Reheat in the microwave or on the stove. Unfortunately, cooked egg noodles don't freeze well. If you'd like to freeze this ground beef stroganoff recipe, it's best to prepare it without the noodles. Freeze the beef-sauce mixture in a freezer-safe container for up to three months. Thaw on the stove and stir in cooked egg noodles before serving. ""My family loved this,"" says Amy Stewart.

These meatballs are tender, juicy, and full of flavor. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics: Here's what you'll need to make the best meatballs of your life: · Ground meat: This meatball recipe uses a blend of ground beef, ground veal, and ground pork. You can switch it up depending on what you have on hand.· Seasonings and herbs: These meatballs are flavored with fresh garlic, fresh Italian flat leaf parsley, and ground black pepper.· Eggs: Eggs keep the meatballs from drying out and they act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the ingredients together.· Cheese: You'll need a cup of freshly grated Romano cheese. If you can, avoid the pre-grated stuff for this recipe.· Italian bread: Slightly stale Italian bread is preferable. If your bread feels soft, try letting it sit out overnight.· Water: Slowly add water to the mixture before you roll the meatballs. It'll keep the meatballs nice and moist. Some reviewers prefer to use milk.· Olive oil: Fry the meatballs in olive oil. Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make this top-rated meatball recipe: 1. Combine the first eight ingredients in a bowl.2. Add the bread crumbs and slowly add the water.3. Shape the mixture into meatballs.4. Fry the meatballs until they're all brown and crisp.

This recipe begins with a 24-hour marinade to allow the flank steak to soak up all the tasty and fresh flavors before grilling. Whether you serve it as tacos, a salad topping, or simply chow down on the tender, flavor-packed steak by itself, this will be the best carne asada you've ever experienced. Carne asada is a Mexican dish featuring steak that's marinated in a lime juice and seasonings mixture. It literally translates to ""grilled meat,"" so the steak is traditionally grilled. Learn more: What Is Carne Asada? This carne asada marinade is packed with delicious ingredients, like: Fruit JuiceOrange juice, lemon juice, and lime juice add fruity flavor to this marinade. Soy SauceSoy sauce lends a rich, savory flavor to the steak. Seasonings and SpicesThis marinade includes cilantro, garlic, chili powder, cumin, paprika, pepper, and oregano. Chipotle PepperThe finely chopped chipotle pepper adds a kick of heat. Olive OilOlive oil keeps the steak moist and helps to lock in the flavors. Making this carne asada marinade is so easy: Just combine all the ingredients in a bowl. Reserve 1 cup of the marinade for use after the steak is cooked. Then place the pounded out steak in the marinade and let it sit for 24 hours. This recipe calls for a 24 hour marination time, and we agree that 24 hours will produce the most flavorful and moist carne asada. However, overnight, or even a few hours, in the marinade is better than nothing. After your steak has marinated, pop it on a preheated grill and cook to your preferred doneness. About 5 minutes on each side will yield a medium-rare steak. Pour the reserved marinade over the steak and serve. ""I did not have the canned chipotle but I did use everything else and my family loved this. Even my 3 year old son who doesn't like beef loved this over the chicken taco we made for him.

1061,Marinated Flank Steak,4.7,"(1,685)","1,164",10 mins,10 mins,2 hrs 25 mins,6,,"Make the best steak of your life with this top-rated recipe. A complex, savory flank steak marinade ensures perfectly tender and juicy beef every time. Flank steak is a lean cut of beef that comes from the cow's lower abdominal muscles. It's a relatively tough cut that's low in fat, which means a few things: Flank steak doesn't need to be trimmed, it's inexpensive compared to other cuts, and it benefits greatly from marination. Flank and skirt steaks are similar in a lot of ways, but they do have notable differences. Skirt steak comes from the diaphragm of the cow, while flank steak comes from the lower abdomen. Also, skirt steak is fattier and has more marbling than flank steak. Flank steak is thicker and wider. No flank steak? No problem. Skirt steak is a great substitute. Top round and hanger steak are also excellent options. This crowd-pleasing flank steak marinade consists of the following ingredients: vegetable oil, soy sauce, red wine vinegar, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, garlic, and ground black pepper. As long as you marinate the flank steak in the fridge for two to six hours, you'll have great results. However, for the absolute best results, marinate overnight or up to 12 hours. There are plenty of ways to perfectly cook a flank steak. In this recipe, the steak is grilled — we love the bold, smoky flavor the grill gives the meat. But you can also easily cook your flank steak in the oven or on the stove. You'll find the step-by-step recipe for marinated and grilled flank steak below, but here are some rough guidelines for three different flank steak cooking methods: Season and marinate the steak according to your recipe. Preheat a lightly oiled outdoor grill to medium-high heat. Remove the steak from the marinade, shake off excess liquid, and grill on each side to desired doneness. The steak is done when a meat thermometer inserted into the center reads between 130 degrees F and 145 degrees F. Season and marinate the steak according to your recipe. Remove the steak from the marinade, shake off excess liquid, and arrange the steaks in a baking dish lined with aluminum foil. Bake until a meat thermometer inserted into the center of the steak reads between 130 degrees F and 145 degrees F. Season and marinate the steak according to your recipe. Sear the steaks in a cast-iron skillet until lightly browned on the bottom, then flip to the other side and repeat. Finish the steaks in a preheated oven. Bake until a meat thermometer inserted into the center of the steak reads between 130 degrees F and 145 degrees F. It depends on the degree of doneness you're after. This marinated flank steak should be totally cooked after about 5 minutes of grilling time on each side. Of course, tastes and preferences will vary. Pair your marinated flank steak with a side salad, grilled or roasted veggies, or something starchy (such as mashed potatoes or French fries). In need of a little inspiration?

1062,Best Damn Chili,4.7,(681),534,30 mins,2 hrs 15 mins,2 hrs 45 mins,12,12 servings,"Are you on the hunt to find the best chili recipe on the internet? Well, stop right there, because you just did! If you're looking for hearty, filling chili that's just the right level of spicy, this is the chili recipe for you. Yes, this recipe does look like you throw everything but the kitchen sink in it, but wow is the long ingredient list worth it. You might as well just make a double batch because you'll be craving more as soon as it's gone. You'll find the full, detailed recipe below, but here's what you can expect when making this chili: In a large pot, sauté the onion, bell pepper, Anaheim pepper, jalapeños, and garlic until softened. Brown the ground beef, then season it with Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, bouillon, and beer. Once combined, add the beef mixture to the vegetable mixture. Stir crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, wine, and seasonings into the beef and vegetable mixture. Bring the mixture to a boil, then simmer until the flavors have blended together, about 90 minutes. Add in kidney beans, then simmer for another 30 minutes, until the beans are hot. In a blender, combine sour cream, cilantro, and cumin to create a crema. Serve the chili topped with crema and any other toppings you like. This chili should already be your preferred level of thickness, thanks to all the thickening agents in it. But if you're having trouble reaching your desired consistency, there are multiple ways to thicken chili. The easiest way is to simply simmer it for longer. The longer it simmers, the more liquid will evaporate. But, if you don't have time to simmer your chili for hours, you can thicken it with cornmeal, cornstarch, or all-purpose flour. Add 1 tablespoon of cornmeal directly to the pot and allow it to simmer for about 10 more minutes to thicken up. Or add a cornstarch or flour slurry — this means 1 tablespoon of water mixed with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch or 2 tablespoons of water mixed with 1 tablespoon of flour. If you add flour or cornstarch directly to the chili, it will clump. Instead, gradually whisk in the slurry then simmer for 10 minutes. Another option is to add more starchy ingredients, like vegetables or beans. These will absorb some of the liquids and thicken the chili. Plus, you'll have more hearty and delicious ingredients to enjoy. Chili is filling enough to stand-alone as a full meal itself, but you can always add sides or even use chili as a ""topping"" for other foods. Try serving it with cornbread, coleslaw, or grilled corn. For more inspiration check out our best side dishes to serve with chili. We love to use chili as a topping over rice, baked potatoes, nachos, and even as a filling for tacos. Let your heart (and stomach) decide how you want to enjoy your chili because the possibilities are endless. Package completely-cooled chili into an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator for up to four days. If you want your chili to last longer, you should freeze it. Ladle completely cooled individual servings of chili into zip-top freezer bags (make sure to squeeze out the excess air). Label and date the bags, and store them in the freezer for up to three months. When you're ready to eat it, thaw it overnight in the fridge and reheat on the stove or in the microwave. ""This really is the best chili recipe and ""the"" go-to for anytime we crave this comfort dish. The recipe is excellent as is. Lately, I've been swapping out a can of kidney beans for sweet corn kernels and it adds a little sweetness and texture—can't beat spicy sweet,"" says Michael Izo. ""HOLY COW!

1068,Doc's Best Beef Jerky,4.7,(433),357,20 mins,4 hrs,12 hrs 20 mins,10,,"If you like store-bought jerky, you'll absolutely love this homemade beef jerky. It's the best on the internet, if we do say so ourselves! All you'll need is some round steak, our irresistible beef jerky marinade, and a dehydrator to make this top-rated recipe. Beef jerky is lean, trimmed beef that has been cut into strips and dried. Drying (or dehydrating) meat with heat and salt slows bacterial growth dramatically, stretching its lifespan by many months. The word ""jerky"" comes from a Quechua word: ""Ch'arki,"" which literally means ""dry, salted meat."" This beef jerky is made from steak cut into thin strips and marinated in a sweet-savory marinade made with spices, sauces, and seasonings that you probably already have on hand. Some beef jerky recipes can be made in the oven, but this one requires a food dehydrator. What makes this beef jerky marinade so absolutely irresistible? The combination of sweet, savory, and umami-rich ingredients. This marinade is a beautiful blend of soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, liquid smoke, brown sugar, salt, pepper, meat tenderizer, garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika. Truly, it couldn't be easier to make this beef jerky. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect: Arrange beef strips in a single layer in a glass baking dish. In a bowl, mix together all of the marinade ingredients until they're well-combined. Pour the marinade over the beef, cover, and place in the fridge for 8 hours or up to overnight. Remove the strips from the marinade and place them between two sheets of plastic wrap. Pound the beef to 1/8-inch thickness with a meat mallet. Dry the beef in a dehydrator set to the highest setting for about 4 hours, or until the jerky is done to your liking. Avoid anything with a high fat content — the more fat there is, the harder it'll be to achieve the dry and chewy texture you're after. Plus, fatty cuts will cause the jerky to spoil more quickly. Choose a fresh, lean cut instead. This recipe calls for round steak. You could use sirloin or flank steak, but they'll be a bit pricier. Homemade beef jerky doesn't last quite as long as commercial beef jerky. We recommend enjoying this jerky within three months for the best texture and flavor. Store your homemade jerky in an airtight container in a cool, dry place for up to a month. Move it to the fridge to extend the shelf life by a couple more months. If you invest in a vacuum sealer, you could make your beef jerky last for up to a year. ""We raise cattle, and I routinely use a dehydrator to make jerky from our freezer full of fresh beef,"" says Wendy James Ashworth. ""Today I made this recipe as well as my family's reigning favorite jerky recipe. In a side-by-side taste test, this recipe was declared (5-0 votes) as the new favorite!"" ""You might as well double this recipe to start with,"" advises cheri. ""This is by far the best basic jerky recipe out there. As is, it is GREAT and it leaves room for tweaking without destroying the results. Add a teaspoon of ground or crushed red pepper for a little kick. Bump up the sugar or add honey for a sweeter side."" ""It is amazing,"" raves Jeremiah Tyson.

1069,The Best Chicken Fried Steak,4.5,"(1,450)","1,088",20 mins,20 mins,40 mins,4,,"Looking for the best chicken-fried steak of all time? Well, your search ends here! This top-rated recipe results in a tender, juicy steak with an irresistibly crispy coating. Learn how to make the greatest chicken-fried steak of your life — and get smart storage and serving tips. The aptly named chicken-fried steak is a dish that consists of steak fried in the same manner as fried chicken. The meat is coated with a seasoned flour mixture, then deep-fried to crispy perfection. A Southern favorite, chicken-fried steak is actually very similar to Wiener schnitzel (an iconic Austrian dish of breaded and fried veal). Chicken-fried steak and country-fried steak are very similar Southern dishes that are often confused with one another. Many people use the terms interchangeably, but they are slightly different: Chicken-fried steak is often topped with a cream gravy, while country-fried steak is typically served with brown gravy and onions. Also, chicken-fried steak is usually slightly crispier than its country-fried counterpart. The best cut of beef for chicken-fried steak is cube steak, or another steak variety that has already been tenderized. This recipe, like most others you'll find on the internet, calls for cube steak. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's what you can expect when you make the best chicken-fried steak ever: Using a meat mallet, pound the steak until it's about ¼-inch thick. Place two cups of flour in a shallow bowl and set aside. In another bowl, combine the baking powder, baking soda, 1 teaspoon of the pepper, and ¾-teaspoon of the salt. Add buttermilk, hot sauce, egg, and garlic to the second bowl. Stir to combine. Heat vegetable shortening oil in a deep cast-iron skillet to 325 degrees F. While the shortening is heating, dredge a steak in flour and shake off the excess. Dip the entire flour-covered steak in the buttermilk mixture, then dredge it again in flour. Repeat with the remaining steaks. Fry steaks until evenly golden brown. Remove steaks and place on a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Drain the fat from the skillet, reserving ¼ cup and as much of the solid remnants as you can. Add the reserved fat and heat the skillet over medium-low heat. Whisk in the remaining flour. Add the milk and bring the gravy to a simmer. Cook until thick and season to taste. Serve over finished chicken-fried steaks. Looking for delicious side dish inspiration?

Nobody will know just how easy it was to make. Even beginners will love this top-rated standing rib roast recipe. A standing rib roast, also known as a prime rib roast, is a cut of beef from the primal rib. It's called a standing rib roast because it's usually cooked ""standing"" on the bones (so that the meat doesn't touch the pan). Prime rib is generally considered a superior cut of beef: It's tender, juicy, and wonderfully flavorful. Though this rib roast recipe is incredibly impressive, it's surprisingly simple to make. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect: Rub the room temperature roast with seasonings and place it on a rack in a roasting pan with the fatty side up and the rib side on the bottom. Roast in a preheated oven for an hour, then turn off the oven. Let the roast stand in the hot oven for about three hours without opening the door. Heat the oven again and let the roast continue to cook until it reaches an internal temperature of at least 145 degrees F. This rib roast is simply seasoned with salt, ground black pepper, and garlic powder. Of course, you can add more seasonings to taste (but make sure not to overpower the meat's natural flavor). This rib roast recipe should be done in a little under five hours, with about 90 minutes of actual cook time.

1082,Roasted Pork Loin,4.5,"(1,365)","1,054",20 mins,1 hrs 30 mins,1 hrs 50 mins,8,1 pork loin,"If you're tired of dry and boring pork loin, then this is the recipe for you. Not only is this Roasted Pork Loin heavily seasoned with garlic, rosemary, salt, and pepper, but it's also basted every 30 minutes with an olive oil and white wine pan sauce. So, if you're looking for a way to use that boneless pork loin, this recipe will yield the perfect juicy and flavorful result that no one will be able to resist. Don't get confused by their similar names, pork loin and pork tenderloin are actually two different cuts of meat. The pork loin is wider, shorter, and flatter and comes from the back of the pig. Pork loins can be boneless or bone-in. While the pork tenderloin is long and narrow and comes from the muscle that runs down the pig's backbone. Pork tenderloins are always boneless. You may also see pork loins called pork loin roast, center-cut pork roast, center-cut pork loin roast, center-cut rib roast, center loin roast, or pork loin rib half. There are a few methods for cooking pork loin. The easiest way is to roast it in the oven, like in this recipe. Make sure to consistently baste your pork loin while it cooks to keep the meat juicy and allow it to soak up all the flavors. Then serve the roast with the extra pan sauce as well. You can also quickly pan-sear your pork loin first before roasting it in the oven for a light crisp on the outside. Or, take your pork loin outside and grill it over medium heat. Learn more: How to Cook Pork A good rule of thumb is to cook pork loin 25 minutes per pound at 350 degrees F (177 degrees C). The internal temperature should be at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), so use a thermometer to know when it's done. The National Pork Board recommends the following cooking times for roasting pork loin at 350 degrees F (177 degrees C) in the oven: New York Pork Roast (2 pounds): 26-28 minutes per poundNew York Pork Roast (3-5 pounds): 20-25 minutes per poundSirloin Pork Roast (2 pounds): 26-28 minutes per poundSirloin Pork Roast (3-5 pounds): 20-25 minutes per poundPork Crown Roast: 12-15 minutes per poundRack of Pork: 25-40 minutes per poundSirloin Pork Roast: 25-40 pounds per pound You'll want to let your pork loin rest at least three minutes before serving. But, if you can wait longer, resting for about 10 to 15 minutes will result in an even juicier roast. As your pork loin rests, it will continue to cook more so use a thermometer to check the internal temperature for the level of doneness you want. Medium-Rare: 145-150 degrees F (63-66 degrees C)Medium: 150-155 degrees F (66-69 degrees C)Medium-Well: 155-160 degrees F (69-72 degrees C)Well: 160 degrees F (72 degrees C) Learn more: How to Make the Perfect Pork Loin Roast ""This roast was excellent!

1084,Good New Orleans Creole Gumbo,4.9,"(1,183)",949,1 hrs,2 hrs 40 mins,3 hrs 40 mins,20,20 servings,"New Orleans-style gumbo is a true taste of Southern tradition. This boldly flavored stew is bursting with fresh, filling ingredients like bell pepper, sausage, stewed tomatoes, and crabmeat. Hot sauce ad Cajun seasonings add a kick that makes this Lousiana dish a favorite amongst our community of home cooks. Learn how to make the best homestyle gumbo right here. Gumbo is one of the most famous dishes to result from Louisiana's shared Creole-Cajun heritage. Gumbo falls somewhere between a thick stew and a hearty soup and can contain ingredients such as chicken, sausage, ham, seafood, okra, tomatoes, and greens. As varied as the recipes can be, there are a few ingredients that all gumbos have in common: homemade stock; the ""holy trinity"" of celery, onions, and green peppers; and roux. Boldly delicious New Orleans-style gumbo is surprisingly easy to make at home. You'll find the full recipe below with step-by-step instructions, but here's what you can expect when you make this top-rated recipe: Great gumbo starts with roux, a flavorful thickening agent made from equal parts fat and flour. Once the roux is a deep golden color, add diced veggies and sausage to the mix. Then, incorporate beef bouillon, hot sauce, tomatoes, and seasonings to intensify the flavor. Let the gumbo simmer for 45 minutes before adding file powder, okra, and seafood. The result will be a lusciously hearty stew packed with Creole spice. Gumbo file, or file powder, is made from dried sassafras leaves. This ingredient was first used by Choctaw Indians and was later adopted by Acadians (Cajuns) when they arrived in the American South. Gumbo file has a deep, earthy flavor similar to thyme and should be added to gumbo in the last minutes of cooking — it helps to thicken and enrich the stew for an authentic taste of New Orleans. Leftover gumbo can be stored safely in the refrigerator for three to four days. Let the dish come to room temperature before placing it in an airtight container to enjoy later. Gently reheat on the stovetop for best results. ""This is one of the best gumbos I've ever had and my family is from the South so that is saying a lot — just don't tell my mother or grandmother,"" shares reviewer mellie18_99. ""I added shrimp, sausage, chicken, and crab meat."" ""This recipe is the real deal,"" raves home cook Pat. ""Don't forget the file gumbo at the very end, it makes a big difference.

1085,Absolutely Ultimate Potato Soup,4.7,"(2,953)","2,272",15 mins,30 mins,45 mins,8,8 servings,"A bowl of this ultra-comforting potato soup will please everyone at your table. This potato soup comes together quickly with basic ingredients. You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect: Cook bacon in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until brown and crispy. Drain bacon on paper towels and drain most (but not all!) of the bacon grease. Cook the celery, onion, and garlic in the remaining bacon grease. Add cubed potatoes and toss with veggies. Return the bacon to the pan and cover all the ingredients with chicken stock. Cover and simmer until the potatoes are tender. In a separate skillet, whisk butter into melted flour until slightly thickened. Whisk in heavy cream, tarragon, and cilantro. Bring the mixture to a boil and cook until thick and creamy. Stir cream mixture into potato mixture. Transfer half of the soup to a blender and puree, then return to the Dutch oven. Season to taste and serve with your favorite toppings, such as crumbled bacon or shredded Cheddar cheese. Russet potatoes work well for this soup because they are starchy and fall apart easily during cooking, resulting in a smooth texture. Stay away from waxy potatoes as they won't break down as well. We love this top-rated recipe because it results in a thick, satisfying soup. If you somehow end up with a thinner consistency than you'd like, though, there are a few ways to thicken it. For an easy fix, just add more boiled potatoes and incorporate them into the soup or stir in instant potato flakes. You can also make a slurry with one part water and one part cornstarch. Stir the slurry slowly into the soup until you've reached the desired thickness. Let the potato soup cool completely, then transfer to an airtight storage container. Store in the fridge for up to four days. Reheat in the microwave or on the stove. Unfortunately, potato soup doesn't freeze well. Not only do potatoes become grainy as they thaw, but dairy-based soups tend to separate during the thawing and reheating processes. Avoid freezing potato soup if you can. If you must freeze potato soup, ladle it into zip-top freezer bags in serving-sized portions. Squeeze out the excess air, seal, label with the date, lay flat in the freezer, and freeze for up to six months. Favorite potato soup toppings include shredded Cheddar cheese, crumbled bacon, green onions, and chives. It's your potato soup – garnish it with as many or as few toppings as you please.

Start by pulling or cutting the woody stem away from the leaves. Roughly cut the greens into two-inch pieces or strips. Culinary producer Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. NicoleMcMom) recommends rolling or folding the large leaves to make the process a little quicker and easier. Once the greens are cut, it's time to wash. Submerge the greens in water (using a large bowl or salad spinner) and allow the grit to fall to the bottom. Drain in a colander and rinse again under running water. Making a tender, flavorful pot of collard greens couldn't be easier. You'll find the full recipe below with step-by-step instructions, but here's what you can expect when you make this top-rated recipe; Begin by cooking bacon slices in a skillet until crisp. Remove the bacon from heat, crumble, and add back to the pan along with chopped onion and garlic. Next, add fresh cut collard greens to the mixture. Cook them gently, just until they begin to wilt, before pouring in broth and seasonings. Reduce heat and let the collard greens cook low and slow — about 45 minutes will result in silky, spicy greens that any Southern grandma would be proud to serve. These classic collard greens pair perfectly with all kinds of Southern dishes, from fried chicken to country ham. Nicole suggests serving them with barbecue chicken and cornbread for a down-home meal that'll please everyone at your table. Before cooking, fresh (and unwashed) collard greens can be stored in the refrigerator for four to five days. They can also be frozen ahead of time — blanched greens can last for months in the freezer before cooking. What about leftovers? Southern collard greens are usually cooked in large batches, so freezing the remaining portions is a great way to have a delicious side dish on hand when you're short on time. Freeze cooked collard greens in small plastic bags as-is. They'll last up to 12 months. ""I just cooked these greens with black-eyed peas, cornbread, and pork chops, "" shares home cook Shelby. ""We're in the South and my husband has eaten A LOT of collards. He's raving right now!"" ""Just the right balance of flavors,"" says reviewer Alexis. ""The only variations I made were more bacon and onions, and a dash of apple cider vinegar. I don't think I'll ever prepare these any other way!""

You can switch it up depending on what you have on hand.· Seasonings and herbs: These meatballs are flavored with fresh garlic, fresh Italian flat leaf parsley, and ground black pepper.· Eggs: Eggs keep the meatballs from drying out and they act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the ingredients together.· Cheese: You'll need a cup of freshly grated Romano cheese. If you can, avoid the pre-grated stuff for this recipe.· Italian bread: Slightly stale Italian bread is preferable. If your bread feels soft, try letting it sit out overnight.· Water: Slowly add water to the mixture before you roll the meatballs. It'll keep the meatballs nice and moist. Some reviewers prefer to use milk.· Olive oil: Fry the meatballs in olive oil. Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make this top-rated meatball recipe: 1. Combine the first eight ingredients in a bowl.2. Add the bread crumbs and slowly add the water.3. Shape the mixture into meatballs.4. Fry the meatballs until they're all brown and crisp.

Well, you can! You just need a good recipe — and that's where we come in. This top-rated recipe produces tender, juicy ribs that you'll want to make again and again. Baby back ribs (also called pork back ribs) come from high on the back of the hog, where the loin muscle meets the backbone. This lean cut of pork is extremely tender and flavorful. Baby back ribs can be smoked, grilled, or baked. They're usually seasoned and often served with a sweet and savory barbecue sauce. Spare ribs are cut from the bottom portion of the rib cage, while baby backs are cut from the top portion of the rib cage. Baby back ribs are leaner and cook faster than spare ribs, their heavier counterpart. Some people say spare ribs have richer flavor because they're more marbled, but baby backs are more popular because they have more meat and are more tender. Make perfect baby back ribs in the oven by following a few simple steps. You'll find Chef John's full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect: Mix ancho chile powder, white and brown sugars, salt, black pepper, cumin, dry mustard, cayenne, and chipotle pepper in a small bowl. Place the rack on an aluminum foil-lined baking sheet. Prick the rack several times with a knife. Season liberally on both sides with dry rub, then seal tightly in foil. Bake until tender and cooked through. Remove the rack from the oven, let cool slightly, and open the foil seal. Completely coat the rack in barbecue sauce, brushing it on all sides. Return it to the oven (with the foil open) and bake for about 10 more minutes. Remove from the oven again and brush again with barbecue sauce (on the meat side only). Repeat this process about four times, then cut and serve. This recipe generally takes about 2 hours and 50 minutes to cook. However, racks vary in size — bigger racks might take longer to cook, while smaller ones might be ready more quickly. Turn to your digital food thermometer for the most precise results: Ribs are technically safe to eat when they reach an internal temperature of 145 degrees F, but they will be most tender and juicy between 190 and 200 degrees F.

This 5-star grilled pork chop recipe has reviewers' mouths watering thanks to the spectacular honey-garlic glaze — but the 25-minute fridge-to-table time is also a perk too. There might not be an actual award given to pork chops, but if there was, this 5-ingredient dish would surely win it thanks to the sauce alone. Reviewers rave about the ketchup, honey, soy sauce, and garlic glaze that is brushed onto the chops on the grill. In fact, many reviewers suggest marinating the pork chops in the glaze first, brushing them with more glaze on the grill, and making an extra batch of sauce to serve on the side for dipping because it's just that good. When the weather is nice, take your pork chops outside and throw them on the grill. Not only will they cook up quickly, but they'll also get the tasty grill marks that everyone loves. Grilling pork chops is incredibly simple, all you have to do is preheat your grill to medium heat and oil the grate. Then lightly brush the glaze over the chops and sear them on both sides until they are no longer pink in the middle. You'll want to grill your pork chops until they are no longer pink in the middle and reach an internal temperature of at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). The National Pork Board recommends about eight to 12 minutes for pork chops that are ¾-inch thick. However, every grill is different so it may take some grills longer while some may cook faster. In this recipe, you can use either boneless or bone-in pork chops. They typically take about the same amount of time to cook, so it's really up to personal preference or what's on sale at the grocery store this week. You will want to pay attention to the thickness of the pork chop, though. Thicker pork chops will take longer to cook, but they won't dry out as easily as thinner pork chops can on the grill. So, thicker pork chops are usually recommended for grilling. Yes! If you don't have a grill or the weather isn't looking that great, you can bake these pork chops instead. Reviewers tend to bake them at 350 degrees F for about 40-45 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F.

1099,Traditional Filipino Lumpia,4.8,(506),405,40 mins,25 mins,1 hrs 10 mins,15,30 lumpia,"Did you know you can make restaurant-worthy lumpia in your own home? This lumpia produces perfectly crispy and absolutely irresistible spring rolls every time. Lumpia are fried spring rolls that are found in Filipino and Indonesian cuisines. The rolls traditionally feature a thin pastry skin (a.k.a. a lumpia wrapper) and are often stuffed with a savory mixture of ground pork and vegetables. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect: 1. Make the filling: Cook the pork until crumbly and set aside. Drain most (but not all) of the grease. Cook the onion and garlic in the remaining grease. Return the pork to the pan and stir in the veggies, cilantro, and seasonings. Remove from heat and let cool.2. Assemble the lumpia: Place three tablespoons of the filling on the wrapper and follow the instructions to roll and seal the lumpia. Repeat until all the rolls are assembled.3. Fry the lumpia: Heat oil in a skillet. Fry the lumpia three to four rolls at a time. Turn until all sides are brown. Drain on a paper towel. Lumpia is often served with a sweet chili dipping sauce (this 5-ingredient Hot and Sweet Dipping Sauce is an excellent choice). If you're sensitive to heat, you could try with a classic Sweet and Sour Sauce. Make it a meal by pairing your lumpia with Garlic Fried Rice or serving it as an appetizer for a traditional Filipino main dish, such as Caldereta. Allow the rolls to cool, then transfer the leftovers to an airtight container or wrap them tightly in foil. Store the lumpia in the refrigerator for up to four days. Yes, but it's best to freeze the lumpia before you fry it. To freeze un-fried lumpia: Arrange the cooled rolls on a baking sheet, then cover with storage wrap. Freeze for a few hours or up to overnight. When the lumpia are frozen solid, transfer the rolls to a zip-top freezer bag (don't forget to squeeze out the excess air) or another freezer-safe container. Wrap in foil for added protection. Lumpia can be frozen for up to three months. There's no need to thaw — just go ahead and fry the lumpia from frozen. ""I had wanted to make these for a long time, but I thought that they would be really hard to make,"" says misspiggy067. ""Boy, was I wrong. They are really easy and they taste wonderful!! My family loves them."" ""I am Filipino and have tasted many different Lumpia recipes...this was a great one,"" raves Baker.

1101,Best Egg Rolls,4.4,(693),549,25 mins,15 mins,40 mins,8,8 egg rolls,"It's easier than you think to make restaurant-worthy egg rolls in the comfort of your own kitchen. With this top-rated recipe, you'll learn how to make perfect egg rolls (and how to roll egg rolls) in less than half an hour. An egg roll is a fried appetizer that's found on countless Chinese-American restaurant menus. It consists of a thick, crispy wheat flour skin filled with shredded cabbage, pork, and other ingredients. Egg rolls are fried in hot oil, served warm, and usually dipped in duck sauce or soy sauce. Contrary to popular belief, egg rolls don't contain any eggs. So where does the name come from? Nobody quite knows, but there are a couple of theories. One legend holds that the popular appetizer is a twist on a dish called Dan Gun, which consists of ingredients (such as ham, sprouts, and mushrooms) wrapped in a thin omelet. Since omelets are made of eggs, the newer dish was called an ""egg roll."" This egg roll recipe calls for a ginger- and garlic-packed filling of pork, cabbage, and carrots. The filling is stuffed in a store-bought egg roll wrapper, which is sealed with a flour paste and fried to crispy perfection in hot peanut oil. Egg rolls and spring rolls are both cylindrical appetizers associated with Chinese cuisines, but there are few notable differences. Spring rolls are wrapped in thin flour or rice wrappers before being baked, fried, or left uncooked. Egg rolls, meanwhile, are wrapped in a thick wrapper that is then deep-fried. Spring rolls, which have ancient Chinese origins, are usually stuffed with seasonal vegetables and sometimes chicken or shrimp. Egg rolls, which were likely invented in the U.S, are often filled with pork and veggies. The egg roll is an ancestor of the spring roll. You'll find the full recipe below (including step-by-step instructions for how to roll egg rolls), but here's a brief overview of what can you can expect: Cook seasoned ground pork until brown and crumbly. Mix cooked pork, cabbage, and carrots in a large bowl. Meanwhile, mix flour and water in a small bowl. Lay one egg roll wrapper on a clean work surface. Place a scoop of the filling in the center of the wrapper and roll. Fold tightly and seal with flour paste. Fry the egg rolls until they're golden-brown and crispy. Drain on wire racks and/or paper towels. Sprinkle the finished egg rolls with sesame seeds (if you have them) and serve with your dipping sauce of choice.

Everyone in your family will love it and you will have found a new go-to recipe that has hearty and filling ingredients — it's a win-win! The ingredients in this bake are quite simple — and you probably already have most of them on hand. Here's what you'll need: Olive OilThe olive oil is used for cooking your sausage, potatoes, and veggies in the skillet. Italian SausageChoose your favorite Italian sausage (mild, medium, or hot will work) for this recipe. PotatoesYou can use whatever potatoes you like, as long as you peel and thinly slice them. But for faster cooking and less chopping, try smaller red potatoes or fingerlings so you can eat them whole. Bell PeppersBoth red and green bell peppers are used in this recipe — and, hey, if you have yellow or orange, throw those in too! OnionsYellow onions will work best here for their caramelized flavor. White WineWhite wine adds flavor to the veggies and sausage. Plus, it keeps the dish moist during baking. Chicken StockThis recipe uses chicken stock, though you can use any stock you have on hand in a pinch. SeasoningsLightly season the sausage and vegetables with Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. You'll find the full recipe below, but here's what you can expect when making this recipe: In a skillet over medium heat, first, you'll brown the Italian sausage. After it's evenly brown, add it to a baking dish. Then, in the same skillet, cook the potatoes until brown. Add those to the baking dish. Next, in the same skillet, cook the bell peppers and the onion until they soften. Add them to the baking dish. Cover the sausage, potatoes, peppers, and onions with white wine, chicken stock, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Bake the dish until hot and bubbling. As a main course, this dish already has a lot going on: meat and veggies in a savory sauce. But there's always room for extra sides. You can serve it alongside coleslaw, potato salad, macaroni and cheese, or even more grilled vegetables. ""I found this recipe a few years ago, marvelous!

Even my 5yr old niece who is a notoriously picky eater ate it up quickly. The only change I made was subbing the wine for more chicken broth because I didn't have any wine.

Mix until combined and refrigerate until chilled and ready to use. Slowly pour hot water over flour and kosher salt. Stir until a dough forms. Knead the dough until smooth and elastic. Wrap the dough ball in plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes. Divide the dough ball into four equal pieces (keep the other pieces covered while working). Roll the dough into a log and divide into six equal pieces. Roll each piece into a pot sticker wrapper. Repeat until all dough is used. Place a small amount of pork filling into the center of each wrapper. Wet the edges of the wrapper and fold the two sides together. Pinch the edges together. Tap the pot sticker on the work surface to flatten it, then add a slight curve so it can stand on its own. Combine rice vinegar and soy sauce in a bowl. Set aside until ready to serve. Pan-fry the pot stickers until golden brown. Add water and steam for three minutes. Uncover and continue to pan-fry until water has evaporated and the pot stickers are crunchy. We love Chef John's method for cooking pot stickers. For crunchy, yet tender pot stickers, first pan-fry them in oil until the bottoms are golden brown. Add water to the skillet and cover — steam the pot stickers for three minutes. Uncover and allow to pan-fry again until the water has evaporated and the bottom of the pot stickers are crunchy. Chef John's dipping sauce for pot stickers is super simple and delicious. Just combine soy sauce and rice vinegar in a bowl. To dress up the sauce, you can also add hot sauce, garlic, minced green onions, or ginger. Store leftover pot stickers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to four days. Reheat in the microwave until warmed through. If you want the crispy bottom, reheat in the microwave until warmed through, then pan-fry in oil until crispy. Uncooked pot stickers are freezer-friendly. Simply follow the recipe until the pot stickers are assembled, but don't cook them yet. Transfer the pot stickers to a baking sheet and flash freeze them for a few hours (or until they're frozen solid). Transfer the now-frozen pot stickers to a zip-top freezer bag and freeze for up to three months. When you're ready to eat, there's no need to thaw the pot stickers. Simply follow this recipe to cook them from frozen. However, you may need to add a few minutes of cook time to account for the frozen temperature. ""My 17 yr old daughter said: 'It was better than restaurant quality,' says Denise Perchall. ""I did use wonton wrappers from the grocery, instead of making my own dough.

1144,Perfect Ten Baked Cod,4.6,"(1,122)",858,10 mins,25 mins,35 mins,4,4 servings,"This baked cod gets its wow-factor from a lemony, buttery cracker topping that contrasts beautifully with the tender, flaky fish. It's an upscale dish that uses simple, affordable ingredients and is ready in under 40 minutes, making it equally appropriate for busy weeknights or fancy dinner parties. This recipe takes a mild, affordable fish like cod and transforms it into a salty, buttery, herbaceous seafood dish worthy of a restaurant menu. Cod loins are baked in melted butter, then topped with a lemon, wine, and cracker topping and then baked a final time. As it bakes, the buttery crumb topping incorporates into the melted butter, creating a thickened, rich sauce for spooning over the fish. No need to plate this dish — the crumb topping adds plenty of visual appeal. Serve it straight from the baking dish with lemon wedges, parsley, and green onions. Cod loin, considered the prime cut for cod, is cut from the middle section, or the thickest part of the fillet. When cooked, it's generally more moist and succulent, and cooks more evenly than standard cod fillets. Cod loins are also sold as smaller cuts, which makes them easier to work with. Cod fillets on the other hand are vertical cuts from the body, and can often be too big for a single portion. You can substitute cod fillets for loins in this recipe, just be sure to adjust the cooking time if your fillet is large. Here, cod loins are baked at 400 degrees F (204 degrees C) for a total of 20 minutes. If you want, you can test the doneness of your fish using a meat thermometer; the USDA recommends a minimum internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) for fish. If you are using a large cod fillet in place of a cod loin, you may need to increase the cooking time depending on the size and thickness of your fillet. Yes, you can bake cod directly from frozen. Increase the cooking time by about 50 percent (7-10 minutes), depending on the size of your cod. We recommend a light, dry white wine like Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, or an unoaked Chardonnay. These will bring out the dish's flavor without overwhelming it. Avoid rich, oaky white wines like an oaky Chardonnay. And no need to splurge on a fancy wine — as wine cooks, the subtle nuances of a more expensive wine will be lost. Unlike many seafood dishes, this baked cod is packed with flavor, so simple, mild side dishes are the way to go. Recipe creator Pam suggests serving this dish with rice pilaf and sauteed spinach. Other simple side dish ideas include roasted carrots, quinoa, potato wedges, and sauteed green beans. ""LOVED the buttery crumb topping and the wine really gave this a nice flavor,"" says Allrecipes Allstar Christina. ""I did use Italian seasoned bread crumbs in place of the crackers, because I didn't have any crackers on hand, but they turned out fine,"" says reviewer JulieH.

It's actually quite simple (with the right recipe, of course). This top-rated grilled salmon recipe will quickly become a staple in your summertime dinner rotation. There are plenty of delicious ways to marinate fish for grilling, but we're partial to this sweet and savory salmon marinade: Salmon filets are seasoned with lemon pepper, garlic powder, and salt, then marinated in a delicious combination of the following ingredients: soy sauce, brown sugar, water, and vegetable oil. Make sure to let the filets marinate in the fridge for at least two hours to reach their full flavor potential. Grilling the perfect salmon is probably easier than you think. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect: Season and marinate the salmon for at least two hours in the refrigerator. Preheat a grill and lightly oil the grate. Place the salmon on the grill and discard the marinade. Cook on each side until the fish flakes easily with a fork. The best temperature to grill salmon depends on a number of factors, including whether or not you're grilling the fish in foil. In this recipe, we grill the salmon directly on the grate without foil. For perfectly flaky salmon every time, we recommend grilling over medium heat. If you follow this recipe, your salmon should be perfectly grilled after about six to eight minutes on each side. Fish should be cooked to a minimum internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) before consuming, according to the USDA. Insert an instant read thermometer into the thickest part of the fish to make sure it's safe to eat.

Nicole McMom) calls this grilled salmon ""the perfect summer meal that comes together in a matter of minutes."" Here are a few of her best tips and tricks for making this simple, seasonal staple: · You might be tempted to stir the seasonings (lemon pepper, garlic powder, and salt) into the marinade instead of sprinkling it over the fish — but don't give into this temptation! Seasoning the salmon directly before adding it to the marinade is the key to a crispy crust.· Salmon has a tendency to stick to the grill grates. To prevent sticking: Use a grill brush to make sure the grates are completely clean, make sure the grill is ""screamin' hot"" (Nicole's words) so that the fish is able to naturally release, and use tongs and a paper towel to make sure the grates are thoroughly oiled before adding the salmon.· Brown sugar adds irresistible sweetness and helps with perfect caramelization, but it cooks extremely quickly. Make sure you shake off any excess marinade before grilling to prevent burning.· To achieve magazine-worthy grill marks, start grilling with the salmon's flesh side down. Flip it to finish cooking and use a fish spatula to easily remove it from the grate.· Finish the grilled salmon with a squeeze of lemon juice and a garnish of green onions for a burst of flavor and color.

This flavorful rice dish is ready in just an hour. Plus, it'll have your mouth watering the entire time it's cooking thanks to its aromatic ingredients. Trust us, you're going to want to save this recipe! Paella is a flavorful and versatile rice dish that originated in Valencia, Spain. It's traditionally made with rice, meat, seafood, beans, vegetables, and aromatic spices. Learn more: What Is Paella and How Do You Make It At Home? Because paella is so versatile, almost every chef has their own recipe. Here's what you can expect to find in this Easy Paella. ChickenThis recipe calls for chicken breasts, but you can use any cut of chicken you like. Some reviewers choose chicken legs or thighs. ChorizoChorizo will add a little kick to the paella. If you're in a pinch, you can use cubes of cured chorizo to save some prep time. ShrimpBuy pre-peeled and deveined shrimp to save on prep time. RiceOf course, the major ingredient in paella is rice. Any Spanish or short-grain rice will work. VegetablesThis paella has a Spanish onion and red bell pepper. Some reviewers like to add more bell pepper, or even peas. Chicken StockTo keep the paella from drying out, add chicken stock. SpicesPaella is super flavorful thanks to the saffron, bay leaf, Italian parsley, garlic, red pepper flakes, lemon zest, oregano, paprika, salt, and pepper in the dish. Spanish rice, or bomba rice, is the most common rice used in paella. However, any short-grain white rice, or even medium-grain white rice, will work. You'll find the fully detailed recipe below, but here's what you can expect from this Easy Paella recipe. Allow the chicken to marinate in olive oil, paprika, oregano, salt, and pepper in the fridge for a few hours (or overnight). Heat olive oil in a paella pan and stir in garlic, red pepper flakes, and rice. Add saffron, bay leaf, parsley, chicken stock, and lemon zest. Simmer rice for 20 minutes. Cook chicken, onion, bell pepper, chorizo, and shrimp until done. Then add to the rice mixture. Not necessarily. Even though a paella pan is designed specifically for making paella (obviously), you don't need one to make a great paella. A paella pan is wide and shallow, which is helpful to create a nice crust on the paella. But if you don't have the special pan, you can use any wide and shallow skillet. Store leftover (completely cooled) paella in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. After that, the seafood may be at risk of going bad. Reheat paella in a paella pan or skillet on the stove for the best results. What does culinary producer Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. Nicole McMom) love about paella? ""I love this for entertaining because you serve it straight from the dish — and it's actually quite an affordable way to feed a lot of people."" Here are a few of her best tips and tricks for making this one-pot wonder: · As the main ingredient, rice is key to a great paella. Don't rinse it before adding it to the other ingredients! Keep it as starchy as possible.· The beauty of paella is that all the flavors build upon one another as the dish comes together in one pan. Let the meat render fully so the flavorful fat coats the grains of rice.· Paella can be as extravagant or as budget-friendly as you want it to be. Keep it simple with chicken and sausage or incorporate mussels, scallops, calamari, and more.· Once everything is assembled, avoid stirring it too much. Excessive stirring will create a creamy risotto — we're after a more pilaf-like texture. ""Other than adding more chicken and omitting the shrimp, I followed the directions exactly. I think this is the best thing I've ever cooked. My family enjoyed it. I was told repeatedly how good it was. I would suggest ANYONE to cook this, it is easy and you feel accomplished after crafting such a delicious meal,"" says My soul cleaveth unto the dust. ""I made this even easier by using prepackaged saffron rice instead of making my own. I recommend cooking the chorizo separately and draining it before adding it to the mix. I also cooked the shrimp separately and added it at the end, since I think some of the shrimp tends to get overcooked if you have it in a large pot with many other items. I made this for my husband's birthday dinner, with a few tapas as appetizers, and it was wonderful,"" according to Sara. ""This was my first time making paella, and I hoped that it would be as good as all the reviews from others who have made it. It. was. wonderful!

Tuna poke is one of the easiest seafood dishes you can make (seriously, it only takes 15 minutes to prep) and you will never be disappointed by the rich umami flavors the fish has to offer. Whether you're serving it on its own, in a poke bowl, or as a seafood appetizer, this poke recipe needs to be saved to your collection immediately. You can thank us later for introducing you to the best and most versatile poke recipe on the internet. Poke (pronounced POE-keh) is a Hawaiian dish. Its name derives from the Hawaiian word ""to slice or cut."" The name is a good indicator of what the dish is because poke is traditionally sliced raw fish (usually tuna or octopus) that's marinated in a savory, umami-rich sauce made with soy sauce, sesame oil, and green onions. Poke can be eaten as is, but it's typically served in a poke bowl with other ingredients — like rice, vegetables, and hot sauce. This easy poke recipe only has a few ingredients, most of which you probably already have on hand. Ahi TunaBecause you eat it raw, be sure to buy sashimi-grade tuna. Soy SauceSoy sauce provides umami-rich flavors. Sesame OilSesame oil lends a nutty flavor to the marinade. Green OnionsGreen onions add color and a hint of flavor. Toasted Sesame SeedsToasted sesame seeds will add a crunch to the poke as well as a light nutty flavor. Macadamia NutsMacadamia nuts provide a little crunch to go with the soft fish. Crushed Red Pepper (Optional)Use the red pepper if you like a little heat. Making poke is so incredibly easy. Simply combine all the ingredients in a bowl and allow it to marinate in the fridge for at least two hours. Serve as desired. We love serving poke in a poke bowl. There's no one-size-fits-all recipe for poke bowls. You can really let your imagination run wild. Most poke bowls include rice, vegetables (like edamame, cucumbers, carrots), avocado, seaweed, and sriracha. Poke doesn't last that long because the fresh fish can start to go bad. So, poke is best eaten the day-of or the next day. However, you can store poke in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two days. ""Love this recipe.

This recipe produces a moist, flavorful side dish every time. Oyster dressing (or stuffing) is a dish that consists of bread, oysters, and lots of spices and seasonings. The Thanksgiving side is popular in coastal areas, as fresh oysters are usually cheap and plentiful. While some people choose to stuff this flavorful mixture inside the bird, most people opt to enjoy it as a side dish. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this old-fashioned oyster dressing: Cook the vegetables in a large skillet until they're tender. Stir in the bread crumbs and parsley, then remove from the heat. Add the oysters, eggs, salt, poultry seasoning, thyme, and pepper. Moisten the mixture with liquid from the oysters. Transfer to a greased casserole dish and bake until the top is toasted and a knife inserted into the center comes out clean. Yes, you can make oyster dressing in advance.

1158,Seared Ahi Tuna Steaks,4.6,(828),622,5 mins,2 mins,7 mins,2,2 servings,"There's no need to head to a fancy seafood restaurant to get your ahi tuna steak fix. Instead, try this top-rated ahi tuna steak recipe that comes together in just seven minutes — no, seriously, all you need is seven minutes. There are two types of ahi tuna you can buy: bigeye tuna and yellowfin tuna. Bigeye tends to have a buttery taste, while yellowfin has a milder flavor. Both types of ahi tuna can be used for this recipe. You should always buy sashimi-grade or sushi-grade tuna if you plan to eat it raw. This means the fish market has deemed it safe to eat raw. Ahi tuna steaks are extremely easy to make, mostly because they are served rare or medium-rare — they only need to be lightly seared for about one minute on each side. Ahi tuna has a mild flavor, so you'll want to make sure you season it before cooking. This recipe seasons the tuna steaks with salt and cayenne pepper, plus sears them in a pan with butter, olive oil, and whole peppercorns. You could also season your ahi tuna steaks with a simple sauce (like teriyaki sauce, orange sauce, or soy sauce). The best way to cook ahi tuna steaks is in a pan on the stove, but you can also sear them on the grill, or even bake or air fry them. Cooking ahi tuna steaks in a skillet is the preferred method because it will sear the steaks just enough to leave them raw in the center but create a crispy crust on the outside. Sear the steaks in a pan with butter, olive oil, and peppercorns for about 30 seconds to 1 ½ minutes on each side, depending on your desired level of doneness. Season the fish then place them on a preheated grill at high heat. Grill each side for about 2 minutes, until they are charred on the outside but remain raw on the inside. Bake seasoned ahi tuna steaks in the oven at 450 degrees F for eight to 10 minutes. Feel free to flip the steaks halfway through the bake, but it's not necessary. Preheat the air fryer to 380 degrees F, then air fry the seasoned ahi tuna for four minutes. Culinary producer Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. Nicole McMom) says these ahi tuna steaks are ""the best way to get a fine-dining experience in your own home."" Here are some of her favorite tips and tricks for an impressive entree every time: · You don't want to mask the tuna's natural fresh flavor, so Nicole likes to simply season it with just salt and cayenne pepper.· There are two secrets to a perfect sear every time: You need very high heat (higher than you think, according to Nicole) and a very dry surface. The tuna can't be too dry before it hits the skillet, so give it a pat with a paper towel if you're unsure.· Since oil has a higher smoke point than butter, it's perfect for searing ahi tuna steaks — but, if you're like Nicole, you might want to add a little butter anyway for extra flavor. Yes, you can freeze ahi tuna steaks both raw and cooked. For raw ahi tuna, first, wrap the fish in plastic wrap and then aluminum foil or place it in a zip-top bag to seal it. Freeze for up to three months. If you remove ahi tuna from the freezer and don't end up using it, you cannot freeze it again. Ahi tuna should never be frozen again if previously frozen. For cooked ahi tuna, freeze the leftovers in an airtight container or wrapped in aluminum foil and stored in a zip-top bag. Freeze for two to three months. ""Quick, easy and delicious. Served the tuna steaks on a bed of homemade mango, cucumber salsa with a side of grilled sweet corn. The sweetness from the corn combined with the citrus from the salsa enhanced and balanced the flavors from the tuna and chili powder,"" says moto guzzi. ""This is simply wonderful. The tuna melts in your mouth if cooked as directed. The peppercorns add just the right amount of heat,"" raves Janice W Davis. ""I made this exactly as the recipe was written and it turned out great! We usually grill tuna steaks, but it is easy to overcook them on a grill. I felt I could control how rare the steaks were done by searing them in the pan. Be sure to have the pan hot before adding the steaks. Quick and easy...I'll use this method again and again,"" according to Mrs Z.

1159,Old Charleston-Style Shrimp and Grits,4.9,"(1,149)",905,30 mins,45 mins,1 hrs 15 mins,8,8 servings,"Send your taste buds to coastal South Carolina with this restaurant-worthy shrimp and grits recipe. Whether you're a beginner cook or a seasoned pro, this top-rated recipe will impress everyone at your table. Shrimp and grits is a Southern dish from the Lowcountry of coastal South Carolina and Georgia. It's traditionally served at breakfast, but you can often find it on lunch or dinner menus. Nobody is quite sure when the ingredients were first served together, but the first known published recipe appeared in the 1950 edition of Charleston Receipts (the oldest Junior League cookbook still in print). You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect: Boil grits with half-and-half until thick, creamy, and tender. Remove from heat, set aside, and keep warm. A simple marinade of cayenne pepper, lemon juice, and salt makes perfectly flavorful shrimp that doesn't overpower the rest of the ingredients. Cook sausage in a skillet until brown. Remove the sausage from the skillet and replace with bacon. Cook bacon in the skillet until evenly browned, drain on paper towels, then chop or crumble when the bacon is cool enough to handle. Cook bell peppers, onion, and garlic in the bacon drippings. When veggies are tender, return the cooked sausage to the skillet along with the marinated shrimp. Whisk melted butter and flour over medium heat until you have a smooth, golden roux. Pour the roux over the sausage, shrimp, and vegetables in the skillet. Add chicken broth, bacon, and Worcestershire sauce to the skillet. Stir until sauce thickens and shrimp is bright pink. Finish the grits by mixing in Cheddar cheese. Spoon the grits onto plates, then top with the saucy shrimp mixture. While instant and quick grits are great when you're short on time, this recipe requires grits with a coarse grind. Choose stone-ground grits or coarse hominy grits for the best results. You don't necessarily have to serve anything with shrimp and grits. It's incredibly rich and satisfying by itself. However, if you want to go the extra mile, consider pairing this dish with Lowcountry fare (such as Okra and Tomatoes). Store shrimp and grits in separate airtight containers in the fridge. The grits will last for up to four days and the shrimp will last for up to two days. ""Amazing recipe,"" according to DKTRUM. ""I don't even usually like grits and I ate every bit of this recipe – two helpings. The seasonings were perfect and the depth of flavor was outstanding. Make this recipe as written and don't change a thing; you won't regret it."" ""Perfect recipe and my family loved it,"" raves Carly. ""Prep as much as you can ahead of time to make the process easier. I always bake my bacon instead of pan cooking (keeps the house from smelling) and add a bit of olive oil to the vegetables after cooking the sausage (because there is no bacon grease in the pan to cook it in)."" ""I loved this recipe,"" says DILLEAUX. ""Took some to my neighbor and she said it was the best dish I've ever cooked. I stayed relatively close to the recipe, but used less bell pepper. The prep work is a bit time consuming, but everything comes together very quickly once the shrimp go in.""

If you crowd the pot, the oil temperature will go down and the shrimp won't fry evenly.· For smaller batches, you can totally air fry this shrimp!

1181,Crab Legs with Garlic Butter Sauce,4.7,(212),158,5 mins,15 mins,20 mins,2,,"Make any dinner a special occasion with homemade crab legs. Cooked in a flavorful garlic butter sauce, these Snow Crab legs are never a bad idea. This recipe calls for Snow Crab legs, which are known for their mild flavor and easy-to-crack shell. Less expensive than King Crab legs, you should be able to find fresh or frozen Snow Crab clusters at your local grocery store or seafood monger. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you cook these flavorful crab legs in garlic butter sauce: Melt butter in a skillet, then add the garlic and cook until it's translucent. Add the seasonings and cook until the butter is bubbling. Cut a lengthwise slit into each shell. Add the legs to the butter mixture and simmer until the crabmeat is heated through. The crab legs should be fully cooked after about five or six minutes in the bubbling butter mixture. The whole recipe, sauce and all, only takes about 20 minutes to make. It's actually quite simple to eat Snow Crab legs — and you don't even need a special cracking tool. Just pull one of the legs off the cluster, bend at the joint, and pull the joints apart slowly. The meat should slide right out. Helpful hint: Make sure the legs are warm when you crack them, as it's more difficult to get cold crabmeat out of the shell. Store the cooked crab legs in an airtight container in the refrigerator for three to five days. When you're ready to enjoy them again, brush the crab legs with butter (bonus points if you have leftover garlic butter) and bake in a 350 degrees F oven for about eight minutes. ""You may be tempted to increase the sauce since it won't cover the crab completely, but as long as you crack the legs prior to putting them in the sauce, you shouldn't have a problem,"" according to mfreeman89. ""The sauce will lend a wonderful flavor without overpowering the crab."" ""This is my favorite way to prepare crab legs,"" raves Renee. ""The buttery garlic flavor accents the flavor of the crab very well. It was also easy to make. Using pre-cooked crab legs was pretty convenient. Great recipe!""

We're not kidding: Plenty of reviewers say this top-rated halibut rivals anything they've ordered at their favorite restaurants. There are multiple ways to cook halibut (on the stove, in the oven, on the grill), but we're partial to this method. Halibut is perfectly cooked with a flavorful, crispy topping under your oven's broiler. You'll find find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a quick overview of what you can expect when you make this top-rated halibut: Mix the first seven ingredients (everything but the halibut) in a bowl. Arrange the halibut fillets in a greased baking dish. Broil the fish for about eight minutes, or until it flakes easily. Top with the Parmesan mixture and broil for a few minutes more, until the topping is golden and bubbling. This halibut recipe should produce perfectly cooked fish in about 10 minutes under your oven's broiler. You'll know the halibut is done when an instant read thermometer inserted into the center reads 130 to 135 degrees F. Halibut is the perfect fish to please everyone's palates. It has a mild, slightly sweet flavor with a firm and slightly flaky texture. Halibut and flounder are similar fish varieties (they are both white, mild, and firm), but they're not quite the same thing. Halibut is slightly meatier, while flounder is a bit flakier. However, halibut and flounder can be prepared in many of the same ways. If you can't find halibut, this recipe will work well with flounder. Pair this halibut with a side salad for a light dinner, or try it with roasted potatoes or risotto for something a bit more hearty.

Every November, Americans debate the merits of canned cranberry sauce vs. fresh cranberry sauce. The canned sauce, with its signature shape and jiggly texture, is certainly nostalgic. Fresh sauce, meanwhile, usually has a more complex flavor (and a less gelatinous texture). Plus, when you make cranberry sauce from scratch, you're able to customize the ingredients and ratios to suit your taste. Whether you're Team Can or a fan of the homemade stuff, we think you should give this fresh cranberry sauce a try. you definitely won't be disappointed! Buy cranberries that are plump, firm, and unblemished. Avoid bags that contain soft, shriveled, or moldy berries.

1260,Simple Macaroni and Cheese,4.4,(938),743,10 mins,15 mins,25 mins,4,4 servings,"Looking for a homemade alternative to boxed mac and cheese that's just as quick and easy? This stovetop mac and cheese uses staple ingredients and comes together in just 25 minutes. You'll want to bookmark this recipe for busy weeknights. The good news is, it's so simple that once you make it a couple times, you'll likely have it memorized. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni until al dente, about 8 minutes. Tip: For a thicker mac and cheese, double the amount of macaroni. While the macaroni is cooking, go ahead and start on the roux. A roux is a thickening agent made of one part fat and one part flour that makes up the base of this creamy mac and cheese. To make the roux, start by melting butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth. Slowly pour in milk and stir until the mixture is smooth and bubbling. Be careful to not let the milk burn. Finally, the most crucial step: Add cheese! Slowly stir in Cheddar cheese until smooth and melted. We recommend you grate your own cheese because pre-shredded cheese won't incorporate into the mixture as well as block cheese. Once the macaroni is finished cooking, drain and stir into cheese sauce until coated. This stovetop mac and cheese is all about convenience, but if you find yourself with some extra time and a desire for bubbly, baked mac and cheese, you can bake this recipe. To do so, complete the first three steps above, then top with any desired toppings such as bread crumbs, Parmesan, crushed crackers, etc. Bake at 350 degrees F (177 degrees C) for about 15 minutes, or until golden-brown and bubbling. Refrigerate leftover mac and cheese in an airtight container for three to four days. To reheat, stir in a splash of milk or cream and reheat in the microwave or on the stove, stirring periodically. You can freeze mac and cheese for up to six months. Allow the mac and cheese to cool completely, then transfer to a freezer-safe bag, removing as much air as possible. Label with the date and freeze. When you're ready to serve, simply transfer the dish to the fridge to thaw overnight. Reheat as normal. This is a great starter recipe that allows for endless customizations.

Shrimp scampi is a seafood dish made of shrimp cooked in a butter, garlic, and white wine sauce.

You can buy fresh shrimp and peel and devein it yourself, or buy frozen shrimp. Thaw frozen shrimp before using.· Pasta: This recipe uses a 16-ounce package of linguine, but you can substitute the pasta of your choice, like angel hair pasta, fettuccine, or spaghetti.· Butter: Use unsalted butter. You can add salt to taste later in the recipe.· Extra-virgin olive oil: The flavor of the olive oil comes through in this recipe, so use the best quality.· Shallots and garlic: These aromatics add flavor and fragrance to shrimp scampi.· White wine: Use a dry, crisp white wine for shrimp scampi sauce. Pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc are good choices, and you can drink the leftover wine with dinner.· Lemon juice: Use freshly squeezed lemon juice for the best flavor.· Seasonings: Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper amplify the flavors, and a pinch of dried red pepper flakes give shrimp scampi a subtle kick.

1272,Simple Beef Stroganoff,4.1,(942),733,5 mins,15 mins,20 mins,4,,"Homemade stroganoff doesn't have to be hard! This simple ground beef stroganoff comes together in 20 minutes with just six ingredients. Beef stroganoff is an iconic Russian dish that consists of beef in a creamy sauce. According to legend, it was created by chefs who worked for the Stroganov family in the 1800s. The dish is often made with mushrooms and served over rice or egg noodles. Traditional beef stroganoff is made with steak, a roux-based sauce, and sauteed mushrooms. But, as the title suggests, this recipe is simplified. It relies on shortcut ingredients, such as ground beef and canned cream of mushroom soup, to keep the cook time down and to cut down on extra steps. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what can you can expect when you make this ground beef stroganoff: Saute ground beef until brown, then drain the fat. Add the canned soup and garlic powder. Simmer for about 10 minutes, then remove from heat. Stir cooked egg noodles and sour cream into the meat mixture. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Since this ground beef stroganoff is a rather heavy dish, you may not need a side dish at all. A simple side salad, though, is a great way to round out your meal and to add a pop of color. Of course, if you want something a little different, you could leave out the egg noodles and serve the ground beef and sauce mixture over white rice or mashed potatoes. Store leftover beef stroganoff in an airtight container in the fridge for up to four days. Reheat in the microwave or on the stove. Unfortunately, cooked egg noodles don't freeze well. If you'd like to freeze this ground beef stroganoff recipe, it's best to prepare it without the noodles. Freeze the beef-sauce mixture in a freezer-safe container for up to three months. Thaw on the stove and stir in cooked egg noodles before serving. ""My family loved this,"" says Amy Stewart. ""I took a previous reviewer's suggestion and added a packet of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix, I think this is what made it so delicious! I also threw in a small can of mushrooms.

1277,Best Egg Rolls,4.4,(693),549,25 mins,15 mins,40 mins,8,8 egg rolls,"It's easier than you think to make restaurant-worthy egg rolls in the comfort of your own kitchen. With this top-rated recipe, you'll learn how to make perfect egg rolls (and how to roll egg rolls) in less than half an hour. An egg roll is a fried appetizer that's found on countless Chinese-American restaurant menus. It consists of a thick, crispy wheat flour skin filled with shredded cabbage, pork, and other ingredients. Egg rolls are fried in hot oil, served warm, and usually dipped in duck sauce or soy sauce. Contrary to popular belief, egg rolls don't contain any eggs. So where does the name come from? Nobody quite knows, but there are a couple of theories. One legend holds that the popular appetizer is a twist on a dish called Dan Gun, which consists of ingredients (such as ham, sprouts, and mushrooms) wrapped in a thin omelet. Since omelets are made of eggs, the newer dish was called an ""egg roll."" This egg roll recipe calls for a ginger- and garlic-packed filling of pork, cabbage, and carrots. The filling is stuffed in a store-bought egg roll wrapper, which is sealed with a flour paste and fried to crispy perfection in hot peanut oil. Egg rolls and spring rolls are both cylindrical appetizers associated with Chinese cuisines, but there are few notable differences. Spring rolls are wrapped in thin flour or rice wrappers before being baked, fried, or left uncooked. Egg rolls, meanwhile, are wrapped in a thick wrapper that is then deep-fried. Spring rolls, which have ancient Chinese origins, are usually stuffed with seasonal vegetables and sometimes chicken or shrimp. Egg rolls, which were likely invented in the U.S, are often filled with pork and veggies. The egg roll is an ancestor of the spring roll. You'll find the full recipe below (including step-by-step instructions for how to roll egg rolls), but here's a brief overview of what can you can expect: Cook seasoned ground pork until brown and crumbly. Mix cooked pork, cabbage, and carrots in a large bowl. Meanwhile, mix flour and water in a small bowl. Lay one egg roll wrapper on a clean work surface. Place a scoop of the filling in the center of the wrapper and roll. Fold tightly and seal with flour paste. Fry the egg rolls until they're golden-brown and crispy. Drain on wire racks and/or paper towels. Sprinkle the finished egg rolls with sesame seeds (if you have them) and serve with your dipping sauce of choice.

You can typically find egg roll wrappers in the international food aisle, the produce section, or the deli section of the grocery store.

1283,That Zucchini Spaghetti Stanley Tucci Loves (Spaghetti alla Nerano),4.6,(51),46,20 mins,35 mins,8 hrs 55 mins,2,2 servings,"I get a fair number of video ideas watching food travel television shows. During these productions, it's not uncommon for the host to heap praise on the local offerings, but Stanley Tucci (in his new show, Searching for Italy) took this to another level, calling the dish, ""life changing,"" ""unbelievable,"" and ""one of the best things I've ever eaten."" I love a good vegetable-based pasta, so I decided to give this a try. But there was one small problem: It requires the zucchini to be deep-fried first. I'm certainly not against deep-frying and have posted many videos featuring the technique, but if there's a way to make a recipe without forcing someone to set up a fry station in there kitchen, I always try to figure out what that is. This time, there was no way. I tried to broil, bake, and pan fry, but none of the methods worked as well as the ""authentic"" cooking method shown in the show, which was to fry the sliced zucchini in sunflower oil until golden brown. Please trust me when I tell you that the results are well worth the effort. This really was a truly amazing spaghetti, and while I've sauced pasta with zucchini before, I'd never done so by frying it first, and I was sort of shocked what a difference it makes. So, whether you need to go to the market to buy your summer squash or you're a gardener and have way more than you can ever use, I really do hope you give this a try soon. Enjoy!

1300,Italian Wedding Soup,4.6,(983),765,20 mins,30 mins,50 mins,4,,"Warm up with a hearty bowl of Italian wedding soup. This top-rated soup recipe is the perfect bowl of comfort that everyone will love. Want to know the best part? This Italian wedding soup only requires a few ingredients and comes together in less than an hour. Italian wedding soup is a hearty Italian soup consisting of noodles, vegetables, meatballs, and broth. It was originally a ""peasant dish,"" meaning it's made from inexpensive ingredients that anyone could find. Even though it's called ""wedding soup,"" this soup has nothing to do with weddings. The name comes from the Italian phrase ""minestra maritata,"" which actually means married soup. But it's not the marriage we think of — it's actually referring to the marriage of the ingredients and the flavor it produces. Most Italian wedding soups contain these ingredients: MeatballsCombine ground beef, egg, bread crumbs, Parmesan, basil, and onion powder to create the meatballs. BrothThis recipe calls for chicken broth — though reviewers have had luck using different broths too. VegetablesThis soup has escarole and carrots. You can also add onions or celery if you want more color. PastaThis recipe calls for orzo. This particular recipe calls for orzo pasta, which is what we like to use. But you can really use any small pasta you have on hand, like ditalini or acini de pepe. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's what you can expect when making this Italian wedding soup: Combine ground beef, egg, bread crumbs, Parmesan, basil, and onion powder and shape into small meatballs. In a pot, boil broth and add escarole, orzo pasta, chopped carrot and meatballs. Cook at a slow boil until the pasta is al dente. Italian wedding soup really does have it all, so don't feel pressured to serve it with anything! However, we like serving this soup with a warm dinner roll. Store completely cooled Italian wedding soup in an airtight container in the fridge for up to four days. You may need to add more broth or water when you're ready to reheat the soup, as the pasta tends to soak it up. Reheat on the stove or in the microwave until warmed through. Italian wedding soup freezes well. Ladle the completely cooled soup into individually portioned zip-top freezer bags. Freeze flat for up to three months. Thaw in the fridge overnight and reheat on the stove until warmed through. ""I love this soup. The only changes I made was to use mild Italian sausage for the meatballs, which I made in advance, and I used baby spinach leaves instead of escarole,"" says slowcooker. ""I added the spinach during the last minute of cooking. This is a great weeknight soup."" ""I made this for the first time on Easter. My husband and I had had it before but my guests were delighted. It was better than any I had tasted. It has become a family favorite, and I like that it is so simple to make,"" raves one Allrecipes community member. ""This soup is the best! I added chopped celery and used less pasta to make it more soupy!! Or if I have leftover chicken, I add that also. My whole family loves this, especially in the winter months,"" according to one Allrecipes community member.

1315,Authentic Pho,4.3,(180),142,20 mins,7 hrs 5 mins,8 hrs 25 mins,4,,"Craving warm, comforting pho? Well, then let us introduce you to the tastiest pho recipe on the internet. The key to this authentic Vietnamese soup is the flavorful broth that simmers for at least six hours before serving over rice noodles. We promise, this soup is so worth the wait. Pho is a soup consisting of bone broth, rice noodles, thinly-sliced meat (in this recipe, it's beef), and fresh garnishes. As with many foods, the origins of pho are unknown. It is believed to have been created in northern Vietnam in the early 20th century. It gained popularity in many countries after the Vietnam War. Learn more: What Is Pho and How Do You Make It? Because you're making this authentic Vietnamese soup completely from scratch, the ingredient list is a little hefty. Here's what you'll need: Beef Soup BonesUse the shank and knee to make the homemade bone broth. Rice NoodlesYou should be able to find dry rice noodles at most grocery stores, either in the international aisle or another pantry aisle. BeefThis recipe calls for beef top sirloin. Make sure it's thinly sliced so the hot broth can cook it. Fish SauceFish sauce will give the pho a hint of salty, fishy flavor. OnionRoast the onions for an extra depth of flavor. Spices and SeasoningsThis recipe calls for ginger, star anise, and salt. GarnishesGarnish your pho with cilantro, green onion, Thai basil, lime, hoisin sauce, sriracha, or anything else you like. Pho is quite simple to make, it's just a little time consuming. You'll find the full, detailed recipe below — but here's what you can expect when making this pho: Roast the beef bones and onions until the bones are browned and the onions are soft. Combine roasted beef bones, roasted onions, ginger, salt, star anise, fish sauce, and water in a large stockpot. Allow to simmer for 6 to 10 hours. Then, strain the broth into a new saucepan. Allow dry rice noodles to soak for 1 hour. While they're soaking, bring broth to a simmer. Cook the rice noodles in boiling water. Drain and add noodles to a bowl topped with sirloin, cilantro, green onion, and broth. Garnish with your desired toppings. Store broth and rice noodles separately in their own airtight containers in the fridge. They will stay fresh for up to four days. When you're ready to eat, reheat the broth on the stove and rice noodles in the microwave. Combine and enjoy. You can only freeze the pho broth, not the rice noodles. Store completely cooled broth in airtight containers or zip-top freezer bags (frozen flat) in the freezer for up to three months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight and reheat on the stove. ""Fantastic! So cheap and easy to make! A real 'set it and forget it' kind of meal. It took about 8 hours to make the stock really rich and tasty, but it turned out beautifully. Once it's done the only major work is the veggie prep for your pho sides,"" says VegasRedStar. ""Made this the other night. My first attempt at pho. Came out great.

Trade your traditional pie for a pumpkin cheesecake. With two layers of creamy goodness, this decadent treat will be the star of your Thanksgiving dessert table. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this top-rated pumpkin cheesecake: 1. Make the Bottom Layer: Beat cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla together in a large bowl. Incorporate eggs one at a time. Spread half of the batter in the bottom of a prepared graham cracker crust.2. Make the Top Layer: Add the pumpkin puree, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg to the remaining batter and stir gently until smooth. Spread the batter evenly over the first layer.3. Bake the Cheesecake: Bake in a preheated oven until the center is almost set. Allow to cool, then refrigerate overnight. Using an oven mitt, gently shake the cheesecake. If everything looks set except for a small circle in the center, the cheesecake is done. It will finish setting during the cooling and refrigeration process. The pumpkin cheesecake will last for about four days if it's stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator. A cheesecake should never sit at room temperature for more than two hours. You can keep your pumpkin cheesecake for longer if you freeze it. To freeze cheesecake, wrap the whole cake (or individual slices) in a layer of storage wrap. Follow it up with a layer of foil for added protection. Freeze for up to one month. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight. As delicious as this pumpkin cheesecake is by itself, you can take it over the top by serving it with a dollop of whipped cream.

1322,Traditional Filipino Lumpia,4.8,(506),405,40 mins,25 mins,1 hrs 10 mins,15,30 lumpia,"Did you know you can make restaurant-worthy lumpia in your own home? This lumpia produces perfectly crispy and absolutely irresistible spring rolls every time. Lumpia are fried spring rolls that are found in Filipino and Indonesian cuisines. The rolls traditionally feature a thin pastry skin (a.k.a. a lumpia wrapper) and are often stuffed with a savory mixture of ground pork and vegetables. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect: 1. Make the filling: Cook the pork until crumbly and set aside. Drain most (but not all) of the grease. Cook the onion and garlic in the remaining grease. Return the pork to the pan and stir in the veggies, cilantro, and seasonings. Remove from heat and let cool.2. Assemble the lumpia: Place three tablespoons of the filling on the wrapper and follow the instructions to roll and seal the lumpia. Repeat until all the rolls are assembled.3. Fry the lumpia: Heat oil in a skillet. Fry the lumpia three to four rolls at a time. Turn until all sides are brown. Drain on a paper towel. Lumpia is often served with a sweet chili dipping sauce (this 5-ingredient Hot and Sweet Dipping Sauce is an excellent choice). If you're sensitive to heat, you could try with a classic Sweet and Sour Sauce. Make it a meal by pairing your lumpia with Garlic Fried Rice or serving it as an appetizer for a traditional Filipino main dish, such as Caldereta. Allow the rolls to cool, then transfer the leftovers to an airtight container or wrap them tightly in foil. Store the lumpia in the refrigerator for up to four days. Yes, but it's best to freeze the lumpia before you fry it. To freeze un-fried lumpia: Arrange the cooled rolls on a baking sheet, then cover with storage wrap. Freeze for a few hours or up to overnight. When the lumpia are frozen solid, transfer the rolls to a zip-top freezer bag (don't forget to squeeze out the excess air) or another freezer-safe container. Wrap in foil for added protection. Lumpia can be frozen for up to three months. There's no need to thaw — just go ahead and fry the lumpia from frozen. ""I had wanted to make these for a long time, but I thought that they would be really hard to make,"" says misspiggy067. ""Boy, was I wrong. They are really easy and they taste wonderful!! My family loves them."" ""I am Filipino and have tasted many different Lumpia recipes...this was a great one,"" raves Baker. ""I found you have to be very careful with the temperature of the oil, definitely keep it at medium. If the oil is too hot, the outside cooks too quickly and the inner wrapper doesn't get crispy."" ""I almost wish I didn't know how easy and cheap it is to make these in my own kitchen,"" shesinparties.

1359,Chef John's Manhattan Clam Chowder,4.9,(21),21,35 mins,1 hrs,1 hrs 35 mins,6,6 servings,"Canned soup was one of my childhood staples. It was often served for lunch, dinner, and sometimes both. It was usually something brothy, like chicken noodle, chicken rice, or beef barley. Every once in a while, though, we'd get to enjoy a creamy bowl of New England clam chowder. Not only was that a richer, more satisfying change of pace, but we also got to eat handfuls of oyster crackers alongside, which for some reason, still unknown to this day, we didn't get with those other soups. Anyway, the point is that clam chowder was always a treat, so you can imagine my confusion and disappointment when one day we were served ""Manhattan-style"" clam chowder. It wasn't thick, it wasn't creamy, it wasn't clammy, it was…weird. And no, the oyster crackers didn't help. Not only was the soup almost clear (and quite watery), it was also chock-full of large, slimy chunks of virtually tasteless tomato. I mean, how were they even allowed to call this clam chowder? Well, all these years later, I'm now a Manhattan clam chowder lover! Just as long as it's not the canned variety, and instead the thicker, richer, meatier, more decadent version shown here. With or without oyster crackers, I really do hope you give this a try soon. Enjoy! For more Chef John, be sure to subscribe to Food Wishes on YouTube!

Full of cozy flavor and hearty ingredients, this beef stew recipe will warm you up from the inside out. These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated beef stew recipe: · Stew meat: This recipe starts with two pounds of beef stew meat, cut into 1-inch pieces.· Flour: All-purpose flour thickens the broth, ensuring a hearty stew.· Seasonings: This beef stew is seasoned with salt, pepper, Worcestershire sauce, paprika, garlic, and a bay leaf.· Broth: Use store-bought or homemade beef broth.· Vegetables: You'll need carrots, potatoes, onions, and celery. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this slow cooker beef stew: 1. Combine ingredients: Place the beef in the slow cooker, then toss with flour, salt, and pepper. Add the broth, vegetables, Worcestershire sauce, paprika, garlic, and bay leaf. Stir to combine.2. Set slow cooker: Cover the Crock-Pot and cook on Low for 8 to 12 hours or on High for 4 to 6 hours.

1387,Simple Macaroni and Cheese,4.4,(938),743,10 mins,15 mins,25 mins,4,4 servings,"Looking for a homemade alternative to boxed mac and cheese that's just as quick and easy? This stovetop mac and cheese uses staple ingredients and comes together in just 25 minutes. You'll want to bookmark this recipe for busy weeknights. The good news is, it's so simple that once you make it a couple times, you'll likely have it memorized. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni until al dente, about 8 minutes. Tip: For a thicker mac and cheese, double the amount of macaroni. While the macaroni is cooking, go ahead and start on the roux. A roux is a thickening agent made of one part fat and one part flour that makes up the base of this creamy mac and cheese. To make the roux, start by melting butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth. Slowly pour in milk and stir until the mixture is smooth and bubbling. Be careful to not let the milk burn. Finally, the most crucial step: Add cheese! Slowly stir in Cheddar cheese until smooth and melted. We recommend you grate your own cheese because pre-shredded cheese won't incorporate into the mixture as well as block cheese. Once the macaroni is finished cooking, drain and stir into cheese sauce until coated. This stovetop mac and cheese is all about convenience, but if you find yourself with some extra time and a desire for bubbly, baked mac and cheese, you can bake this recipe. To do so, complete the first three steps above, then top with any desired toppings such as bread crumbs, Parmesan, crushed crackers, etc. Bake at 350 degrees F (177 degrees C) for about 15 minutes, or until golden-brown and bubbling. Refrigerate leftover mac and cheese in an airtight container for three to four days. To reheat, stir in a splash of milk or cream and reheat in the microwave or on the stove, stirring periodically. You can freeze mac and cheese for up to six months. Allow the mac and cheese to cool completely, then transfer to a freezer-safe bag, removing as much air as possible. Label with the date and freeze. When you're ready to serve, simply transfer the dish to the fridge to thaw overnight. Reheat as normal. This is a great starter recipe that allows for endless customizations. Here are some add-in suggestions from Allrecipes reviewers: ""I added onion powder, Parmesan cheese and a little bit of cayenne pepper,"" says RRL.

1388,Chef John's Perfect Prime Rib,4.8,"(2,266)","1,940",10 mins,2 hrs 20 mins,4 hrs 30 mins,4,4 servings,"If you've ever carved into a prime rib at a big holiday meal expecting a juicy, perfectly pink interior only to discover a dry, overcooked roast, this recipe is for you. This simple, foolproof ""mathematical method"" for making the very best prime rib will greatly increase your chances of success. Here is the formula: Multiply the exact weight times 5 minutes. For me it was 5.35 x 5 = 26.75 minutes, which we round up to 27. You'll cook your room-temperature prime rib at 500 degrees F for exactly that many minutes. (Twenty-seven minutes, in my case.) Then turn off the oven and wait 2 hours without opening the door. When the time's up, remove the prime rib and slice into the most perfectly medium-rare meat you've ever seen. See? That's all it takes to make foolproof prime rib cooked to a perfect pink that's somewhere just a shade under medium rare. Just make sure you're starting with a prime rib that has been brought to room temperature! This is critical in order for the math to work!Now, while the method could not be easier, there are a couple things that this method requires: a full-size, modern oven with a digital temperature setting that indicates when it is preheated. Older ovens with manual controls can vary greatly, and the doors may not have the proper insulation. Here's another pro tip for you: Because prime rib is expensive, you should always insert a probe-style thermometer to monitor the internal temp of your roast and avoid any chance of over-cooking. Set the probe alarm (125 F for medium-rare) just in case, and pull the prime rib from oven even if there's still time left on the oven timer. Serve your prime rib with Chef John's Beef Au Jus. Enjoy! ""This is a fool proof method for making the best medium rare prime rib,"" says Haiku. ""Your seasonings can be changed according to your preference, but what's listed works perfectly. It's the cooking method that is the key. It cannot be stressed enough, the roast MUST be at room temperature in order for this to work. If it is the least bit cold in the middle of the roast, you will come out with a very rare roast. A mistake I only made once because I was worried about leaving it out to get warm. Don't worry! It will be fine! I usually purchase 4.5-to-5 pound roasts and take it out of the fridge for a minimum of 5 hours to be sure it is room temp. It comes out absolutely PERFECT and juicy every time."" ""I have used this recipe for years and it works perfectly,"" says Nancy. ""ONE THING that will cause the meat to be less than medium rare, besides not having the rib at room temperature, is the fan in newer ovens! I had no issue for many years until I got a new oven. Many new ovens have a fan that comes on when you turn the oven off. It quickly lowers the temp, which, obviously, will not work for this recipe. Since I have a built-in oven, I actually shut off the breaker to the oven so the fan doesn't come on. Otherwise you can just unplug it.""""Absolutely the easiest way to make perfect prime rib every time,"" raves Claudia B. ""But do not be tempted to open up the oven door until time is up!""

Historically, cabbage was paired with pork bacon in Ireland. Irish immigrants in 19th-century New York City, who often lived in the same neighborhood as Jewish butchers, noticed flavor similarities between the corned beef of NYC delicatessens and the pork bacon of their homeland. Thus, corned beef and cabbage was born. These days, it's commonly associated with St. Patrick's Day. Corned beef and pastrami are both deli staples, but they're not the same thing. Corned beef is salt-cured beef that is cooked by boiling, while pastrami is seasoned and smoked beef. Place corned beef and seasoning packet in a Dutch oven, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook until the meat is tender. In the meantime, cut the red potatoes in half and cut the cabbage into wedges. Peel and cut the carrots. When the meat is tender, add potatoes and carrots to the Dutch oven and cook until they're tender. Add the cabbage and cook for about 15 more minutes.

1391,Homemade Dumplings,4.7,"(1,589)","1,297",5 mins,15 mins,20 mins,6,6 dumplings,"Have a hankering for light, fluffy, tender dumplings just like your mom used to make? You've come to the right place. These homemade dumplings are easy to make with just six pantry staples – and they're even easier to eat. With this top-rated recipe, you'll make perfect dumplings every time. A dumpling is a small mass of dough that can be boiled, fried, baked, or steamed. There are a ton of dumpling varieties out there, from pork- and cabbage-filled Chinese dumplings to cheesy Polish dumplings. These boiled drop dumplings, which are popular in the U.S., are often paired with chicken and broth to create a popular comfort food called chicken and dumplings. They're prepared by dropping spoonfuls of dough into a pot of boiling soup or stew. The starch in the dumplings thickens the broth, resulting in a rich stew that's impossible to resist. This recipe is made with just six ingredients you probably already have on hand. FlourThese dumplings start with all-purpose flour, which creates structure and holds the other ingredients together. Baking PowderBaking powder is a leavening agent, which means it releases gas that makes the dough expand. It's responsible for the dumplings' light and fluffy texture. White SugarA teaspoon of sugar adds an extremely subtle hint of sweetness. It also helps the dumplings retain their moisture through the cooking process and slows gluten development, which ensures tender dumplings. SaltA pinch of salt seasons the dumplings and enhances the flavors of the other ingredients. Butter or MargarineCold butter or margarine is cut into the flour mixture to bind the dry ingredients together. It also keeps the dumplings light and tender. MilkWhole milk helps create a smooth, moist dough. To make sure a dumpling is done cooking, pierce it with a fork or toothpick. You'll know it's done when the fork or toothpick comes out clean. You can store leftover cooked dumplings or dumpling soup in an airtight container in the fridge for two to three days. Reheat gently on the stove or in 10-second intervals in the microwave. Some people like to freeze dumpling dough for quick and easy cooking. It couldn't be easier: Just drop spoonfuls of dough onto a baking sheet, flash freeze for at least three hours or up to overnight, then transfer the now-frozen dough to a freezer-safe container or zip-top bag. Label with the date and freeze for about three months. When it's time to use them, let the dumplings thaw for about 30 minutes and then drop them directly into the soup or stew.

1393,Roasted Pork Loin,4.5,"(1,365)","1,054",20 mins,1 hrs 30 mins,1 hrs 50 mins,8,1 pork loin,"If you're tired of dry and boring pork loin, then this is the recipe for you. Not only is this Roasted Pork Loin heavily seasoned with garlic, rosemary, salt, and pepper, but it's also basted every 30 minutes with an olive oil and white wine pan sauce. So, if you're looking for a way to use that boneless pork loin, this recipe will yield the perfect juicy and flavorful result that no one will be able to resist. Don't get confused by their similar names, pork loin and pork tenderloin are actually two different cuts of meat. The pork loin is wider, shorter, and flatter and comes from the back of the pig. Pork loins can be boneless or bone-in. While the pork tenderloin is long and narrow and comes from the muscle that runs down the pig's backbone. Pork tenderloins are always boneless. You may also see pork loins called pork loin roast, center-cut pork roast, center-cut pork loin roast, center-cut rib roast, center loin roast, or pork loin rib half. There are a few methods for cooking pork loin. The easiest way is to roast it in the oven, like in this recipe. Make sure to consistently baste your pork loin while it cooks to keep the meat juicy and allow it to soak up all the flavors. Then serve the roast with the extra pan sauce as well. You can also quickly pan-sear your pork loin first before roasting it in the oven for a light crisp on the outside. Or, take your pork loin outside and grill it over medium heat. Learn more: How to Cook Pork A good rule of thumb is to cook pork loin 25 minutes per pound at 350 degrees F (177 degrees C). The internal temperature should be at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), so use a thermometer to know when it's done. The National Pork Board recommends the following cooking times for roasting pork loin at 350 degrees F (177 degrees C) in the oven: New York Pork Roast (2 pounds): 26-28 minutes per poundNew York Pork Roast (3-5 pounds): 20-25 minutes per poundSirloin Pork Roast (2 pounds): 26-28 minutes per poundSirloin Pork Roast (3-5 pounds): 20-25 minutes per poundPork Crown Roast: 12-15 minutes per poundRack of Pork: 25-40 minutes per poundSirloin Pork Roast: 25-40 pounds per pound You'll want to let your pork loin rest at least three minutes before serving. But, if you can wait longer, resting for about 10 to 15 minutes will result in an even juicier roast. As your pork loin rests, it will continue to cook more so use a thermometer to check the internal temperature for the level of doneness you want. Medium-Rare: 145-150 degrees F (63-66 degrees C)Medium: 150-155 degrees F (66-69 degrees C)Medium-Well: 155-160 degrees F (69-72 degrees C)Well: 160 degrees F (72 degrees C) Learn more: How to Make the Perfect Pork Loin Roast ""This roast was excellent!

1394,Chicken Parmesan,4.8,"(4,432)","3,095",15 mins,20 mins,45 mins,4,4 servings,"Chicken Parmesan is no doubt the most popular non-pasta dish in Italian-American style restaurants. And while this delicious meal may seem fancy, it's actually pretty easy to make at home. In fact, chicken Parmesan is one of those meals that's often best made in your own kitchen. The main problem I have with most versions of Chicken Parmesan served in restaurants is that they drown the chicken in so much sauce and cheese that it ends up being a big soggy clump of chicken and cheese. But it doesn't have to be that way, not with this method. Unlike many restaurant preparations, this method doesn't overwhelm the chicken with sauce and cheese. The key to great non-soggy chicken Parmesan? Don't put any sauce under the chicken cutlets, just a little bit of sauce on top, so the breading stays relatively crisp. If you like a lot of sauce on your chicken Parmesan, that's fine, you can always serve extra sauce on the side. I also use some actual Parmesan cheese in this recipe! Curiously, most versions of chicken Parmesan only use mozzarella. Here, I'm going with a delicious mixture of fresh mozzarella, tangy Provolone and real Parmesan. Another little trick I employ here is to add some grated Parmesan to the breadcrumbs, which adds another layer of flavor. You'll fry the breadcrumb and Parmesan crusted chicken breasts just to golden brown before transferring them to a baking pan and adding sauce (but not too much!), cheese, and herbs. Okay, now let's break it down. Before we get to the recipe, here's your cheat sheet for making the best baked chicken Parmesan: 1. Pound chicken to an even thicknessPound the boneless chicken breasts out to an even width so they cook evenly. Basically, you're pounding the thick part down to the size of the thin part, about a half-inch thick. 2. Don't skimp on seasoningSalt and pepper the chicken well. Then don't bother with salting the flour and bread crumbs. 3. Add Parmesan to the bread crumbs Use Panko bread crumbs mixed with a little finely grated Parmesan cheese. When you fry the breaded chicken, the Parmesan will give it an extra crunch and exciting flavor. 4. Rest before cookingBefore frying, let the breaded chicken sit on the counter for about 15 minutes to allow the coating to adhere to the chicken breast. 5. Go easy on the sauce THE KEY: Don't drown the poor breaded and fried chicken in sauce and smother it in cheese. Too much of a good thing is too much. You did all the work creating a crisp coating, why make it soggy with too much sauce and cheese? 6. Make sure your oven is hot, hot, hot Be sure your oven is completely preheated to 450 F. You'll want the cheese to brown slightly and the breading to crisp up before the chicken gets overcooked, and a nice hot oven is the way to go. Now find out the best wine to pair with your non-soggy, not-too-saucy baked chicken Parmesan. Enjoy! ""Perfectly delicious and beautiful just as instructed!"" says angie. ""As the video explains, too much sauce and/or cheese only takes away from the flavor — I learned this by experience. I suggest having additional sauce and/or cheese available if guests choose to add more on their plate, but personally think less is more in this case."" ""This recipe delivers!"" raves deneice knotts. ""This was SO easy. My chicken was juicy and crunchy plus the cheesy goodness. YUM!! My son said this 'slaps,' which means it's one of the best things he has ever tasted. Thanks! I'll make this again without being afraid of dry chicken."" ""A wonder of wonders!"" raves Joe. ""Watch the vid! Chef John has some cost-effective tips on flouring your chicken. As well as seasoning the chicken, instead of the flour, eggs, and panko. You will never do it any other way again.

1395,Cast Iron Pan-Seared Steak (Oven-Finished),4.5,(45),36,5 mins,13 mins,1 hrs 23 mins,2,2 steaks,"If you're making steaks inside, you've come to the right place. This technique for cooking steak in a cast iron skillet is unbeatable. What sets it apart? It starts on the stove in a cast iron skillet, but you'll finish the steak in the oven. The stovetop-to-oven method produces steaks with a deeply caramelized crust and a tender, perfectly cooked interior. We love this oven-finished steak recipe for a lot of reasons. To name a few: The skillet is the star of the show. Why? Cast iron absorbs and retains heat like no other surface. It heats up fast and cooks evenly. A hot cast iron skillet puts a quick sear on steaks, creating a beautiful caramelized crust, without overcooking the center of the steak. Also, the cast iron skillet goes from stovetop to oven with ease. This recipe calls for beef top-sirloin steaks. Choose steaks that are at least 1-inch thick. If the steak is too thin, the inside will overcook before the beautiful caramelized crust can form on the outside. Of course, this stovetop-to-oven technique works well for more expensive cuts, too. Allrecipes community member Ken Turnbull loves the technique for thick steaks with nice marbling: ""I learned this method from a good steak house almost 50 years ago and always have the best results,"" he says. This simple steak recipe calls for marinating your top-sirloin steaks in a simple marinade made up of common ingredients you likely have on hand: Orange juice, cider vinegar, olive oil, and Worcestershire sauce. The ideal steak marinades are simple mixtures of acid (OJ and cider), fat (olive oil), and seasonings (Worcestershire sauce). The acid tenderizes the meat and delivers a tangy flavor foundation; the fat binds the marinade and helps prevent steaks from sticking; and the seasonings, well, they add flavor. Let the steaks sit for 5 to 10 minutes before serving to allow the juices to redistribute. As your steaks rest, they will also continue to cook slightly. For best results, use a meat thermometer to test for doneness. Here is what you're aiming for: Rare: 125 degrees F (52 degrees C)Medium Rare: 130 degrees F (54 degrees C)Medium: 140 degrees F (60 degrees C)Medium Well: 150 degrees F (65 degrees C)Well Done: 160 degrees F (70 degrees C) ""The outside had a perfect crust and inside it was extremely juicy and tender,"" says Jeffrey Klotzbach. ""I would recommend it to anyone."" ""A 1-inch thick steak is as thin as you want to go,"" says Ken Turnbull. ""For medium rare, I find that between 1 and 2 minutes per side is all that is needed for the sear and that 5 minutes in a 425 degree oven is enough, if not too much, for a 1-inch steak.""

1397,Quick Beef Stir-Fry,4.4,(393),262,15 mins,10 mins,25 mins,4,4 servings,"Need to use up some of your leftover vegetables and other pantry staple ingredients? Look no further than a classic beef stir-fry. This beef and broccoli stir-fry comes together in just 25 minutes and only requires ingredients that you probably already have. And if you don't? You can just skip them! This dish is packed with veggies, beef, and saucy flavors for a weeknight dinner warrior that checks all the boxes. Served with rice or lo mein noodles, this will be the best beef stir-fry you've ever made. The most time-consuming part of making stir-fry is all the chopping. Slicing your meat and veggies into smaller bite-sized pieces can take a little bit of time and effort, but it's worth it for the end result. After you've chopped all your ingredients, you'll cook the beef on one side of the wok, or another large frying pan, and the veggies on the other side of the wok. Once they're all cooked, you can mix the two sides together and add the soy sauce and sesame seeds. Some stir-fry recipes use a specific stir-fry sauce, which can be as basic as broth, soy sauce, sugar, and rice wine vinegar. This quick stir-fry calls for only soy sauce. But you can feel free to add a stir-fry sauce or marinate your beef in one if you prefer. Learn more: How to Make the Easiest Stir-Fry Ever Flank steaks are the most popular choice for making a stir-fry. However, you can also use sirloin steak, skirt steak, Denver steak, or even beef chuck. Beef chuck steak is the most economical choice, but it does require some extra trimming. You'll want to remove the tough tissue from the steaks before frying. If possible, you should use a wok to make beef stir-fry. Woks are large and have sloping sides that let you cook the entire stir-fry in one pan, so you can easily stir and flip the food without fear of it flying out. They also are designed to cook foods quicker than skillets and with less oil. If you can't use a wok (or another carbon steel pan) then any skillet will work. You may just need to cook the meat and veggies in separate batches. When cooking, make sure you heat the pan and oil up first before adding your ingredients — they should sizzle as soon as they hit the heat. And always use an oil with a high smoke point, like canola or peanut oil, for the best stir-fry results. ""I added this recipe to my favorites list not even a month ago and I have made this, using different variations every time, at least 5 times. My family loves this recipe and I've paired it with rice or noodles and it always pleases. I usually use beef stew meat and switch up the vegetables.

Smoking results in an aromatic bird with a delicate, smoky flavor and a beautifully tender and juicy texture. Learn how to smoke a turkey, and get our best seasoning and storage tips, right here. It's easier than you think to make a perfectly smoked turkey. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect: Rinse the turkey in cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Rub the entire turkey with crushed garlic, then sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place the turkey in an aluminum roasting pan. (Note: The turkey should already be clean, with the neck and giblets removed). Stuff the hollowed cavity with butter, cola, apple, onion, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Cover the seasoned and stuffed turkey loosely with foil. Add wood chips to the smoker according to the manufacturer's directions and place the covered turkey in the pre-heated smoker. Smoke the turkey, basting regularly, until the juices run clear and the meat is no longer pink at the bone. How long to smoke a turkey depends on multiple factors, including the size of the turkey and the type of smoker. When you cook it according to this recipe, a 10-pound turkey should be done in about 5 hours. You'll know the turkey is done when an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, reads at least 180 degrees F. For this recipe, you'll preheat your smoker to 225 to 250 degrees F. Low and slow smoking ensures a juicy texture and perfect flavor. We don't recommend smoking a frozen turkey, as a frozen bird may not cook evenly (which may cause foodborne illness). Make sure your turkey is completely thawed before smoking. Learn more: How to Safely Thaw a Frozen Turkey The outside of this smoked turkey is simply seasoned with garlic and salt. The cavity is stuffed with a variety of ingredients (cola, apple, onion, garlic powder, salt, and pepper) to infuse the bird with irresistible flavor from the inside out. When it comes to smoking a turkey, brining is completely optional. The low and slow cooking actually draws the moisture into the turkey instead of out, so you don't need to add anything to keep it juicy. This top-rated recipe doesn't require a brine.

1403,Oven-Roasted Turkey Breast,4.7,(287),207,15 mins,1 hrs 35 mins,1 hrs 50 mins,6,6 servings,"Feeling the pressure to roast a whole bird this Thanksgiving? We're here to tell you that roasting a turkey breast gives you the same great flavor, while saving you money, fridge space, and effort. A turkey breast is generally sized to feed two to three people with leftovers, so it's the perfect choice for a scaled-down celebration. This oven-roasted turkey breast is slathered with an herb butter both underneath and on top of the skin, yielding juicy, flavorful meat and a crispy skin. Be sure to save the drippings for the accompanying turkey gravy! We're partial to bone-in turkey breast because it yields more flavorful, juicier meat. Bone-in turkey breasts tend to be larger and can be sold as a half breast or a full breast (two halves joined at the bone). Boneless turkey breasts typically feature just one breast. You can use boneless in this recipe if you want (we'd still recommend skin-on), but you'll likely need to decrease the cooking time to accommodate for its smaller size. As a rule of thumb, plan to purchase 1 ½ pounds of turkey per person with leftovers or 1 pound of turkey per person without leftovers. This recipe calls for a 3-pound turkey breast, which will easily feed two to three adults, although you can scale it up or down as needed. For more, check out our handy turkey serving size chart. In general, you'll want to cook a bone-in turkey breast for about 20 minutes per pound at 350 degrees F (177 degrees C), or until it reaches a minimum internal temperature of 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). To temp the turkey, insert an instant-read meat thermometer into the thickest part of the breast, not touching the bone. Be sure to allow the turkey to rest for 10-15 minutes before serving so the juices have to settle into the meat. If you do end up with leftovers, there are countless ways to repurpose roasted turkey breast. Add it to casseroles like this Easy Turkey Tetrazzini or sandwiches like this Thanksgiving Sandwich. Browse our entire collection of leftover turkey recipes. ""So much easier than cooking the whole bird, and not a scrap was leftover,"" says reviewer Peter Downing. ""The gravy was especially good — I did use all the drippings instead of just a tablespoon and that was a good thing as my family finished it all!"" says reviewer tmtorby.

1410,Roast Spatchcock Turkey,4.9,(52),42,15 mins,1 hrs 45 mins,2 hrs 10 mins,10,,"Never made a spatchcocked turkey for Thanksgiving? This is your year. Spatchcocking a turkey results in a wonderfully juicy and evenly cooked bird in a fraction of the time. To ""spatchcock"" means to remove a bird's backbone so that it will lay flat while cooking. This method (also known as butterflying) ensures even cooking, juicier meat, and a quicker cooking time. Why? All the turkey parts are exposed to the same amount of heat for the same duration of time, so you don't have to wait around for the thighs to finish cooking while the breast gets dry. These are the ingredients you'll need to make this absolutely amazing roasted spatchcock turkey: · Turkey: This recipe calls for a 10-pound whole turkey. If your bird is larger or smaller, you'll have to adjust the cooking time.· Oil: Olive oil is rubbed all over the turkey before cooking to keep the meat moist and juicy. Plus, it gives the herbs and seasonings something to stick to.· Herbs: Fresh sage, rosemary, and thyme add herbaceous and earthy flavor.· Seasonings: Right before cooking, the turkey is finished with a simple sprinkling of salt and black pepper. It's easier than you think to spatchcock a turkey. You'll find the step-by-step instructions below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect: 1. Remove the backbone: Place the turkey, breast-side down, on a cutting board. Use sharp kitchen shears to cut along one side of the backbone. Repeat on the other side. Discard the backbone or reserve it for making stock.2. Break the breastbone: Use the palm of your hand to press firmly onto the breastbone until you hear a crack. Flatten the spatchocked turkey as much as possible. Once the turkey is spatchcocked, it's a pretty straightforward process. Again, you'll find the full recipe below — but here's a quick preview: Place the turkey on a roasting rack and rub it all over with oil. Season with sage, thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Roast in a preheated oven for about 90 minutes, rotating every 30 minutes. Increase the temperature and continue roasting until the skin is crispy and golden. This recipe should result in a perfectly cooked 10-pound turkey after about an hour and 45 minutes of roasting. You'll need to adjust the roasting time for larger or smaller birds. Of course, you'll need to take the turkey's internal temperature before serving. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh should read 165 degrees F. ""I love making a turkey this way,"" says Sue. ""I place my turkey on a bed of thickly sliced onions and celery placed on the bottom of the baking sheet instead of on a rack. I also add just a bit of chicken broth to the pan."" ""I had to wrestle a little bit to get the backbone out, but it's worth it,"" according to Debra Stevens.

1411,Authentic Louisiana Red Beans and Rice,4.5,"(1,362)",991,25 mins,3 hrs 5 mins,11 hrs 30 mins,8,8 servings,"Looking for a hearty rice dish with a kick? This authentic Louisiana red beans and rice is a budget-friendly recipe with incredible Cajun flavor. Andouille sausage joins garden-fresh vegetables, zesty spices, and long grain rice in this deliciously down-home recipe. Learn all about this boldly savory dish, including tips on choosing the best beans and what to serve alongside it. This multifaceted Louisiana-style red beans and rice recipe is made easier by breaking down the prep into small steps. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect: Start by soaking your beans overnight, and dicing any vegetables beforehand. When you're ready to begin, transfer the soaked beans to a large pot with water. Then, saute onions, bell peppers, garlic, and celery in an oiled skillet until a bit of color appears. Add the cooked vegetables, bay leaves, Cajun seasoning, and other spices to the beans. Bring the bean mixture to a boil before reducing the heat and allowing the ingredients to simmer for two to two and a half hours. Steam the rice during this time and set it aside. Add Andouille sausage to the beans and cook for an additional half-hour. After cooking, pour the spicy sausage and beans over rice, and enjoy a piping hot bowl of tender, meaty, and flavorful perfection. Red beans and kidney beans share a similar color, but they're actually two different types of legumes. Red beans are small, rounded, and have a faintly nutty taste. Red kidney beans are larger in size, with thicker skin and a slightly richer hue. Both can be used to make an appetizing red beans and rice dish, but dried kidney beans may have to soak longer before cooking. Using dry beans in this recipe ensures that they retain their shape during cooking. Dried beans should be soaked prior to cooking for easier digestion and faster cook time. There are two commonly used ways to soak beans: overnight or quick soak. The overnight method is incredibly simple — add beans to a large stockpot and cover them with twice their volume in water. Cover and let sit overnight. Quick soaking consists of bringing dried beans and water to a boil before removing them from heat and allowing the beans to sit for one to four hours (or until they're easily squeezed). Red beans and rice is a versatile recipe that can act as a main or side dish. The big, hearty flavors pair well with foods like cornbread, collard greens, barbecued meats, and fried chicken. Leftover red beans should be stored separately from rice to discourage mushiness. Place both components in their own sealed container and refrigerate for up to a week. To freeze your leftovers, place cooled, single servings of rice into freezer bags and top with a commensurate portion of beans. Tightly seal the bags, and freeze for up to three months. ""I'm a Louisiana boy who grew up eating red beans and rice, shares reviewer jChase. ""This recipe is the real deal. It's become a staple in my home and I serve it up twice a month."" ""I made substitutions because I did not want to venture out to the market for ingredients I did not have,"" says home cook Rea.

Shrimp scampi is a seafood dish made of shrimp cooked in a butter, garlic, and white wine sauce. You can serve shrimp scampi by itself as an appetizer or over pasta as a main dish. · Shrimp: Choose large shrimp (31 to 35 shrimp per pound) to get best results for this recipe. You can buy fresh shrimp and peel and devein it yourself, or buy frozen shrimp. Thaw frozen shrimp before using.· Pasta: This recipe uses a 16-ounce package of linguine, but you can substitute the pasta of your choice, like angel hair pasta, fettuccine, or spaghetti.· Butter: Use unsalted butter. You can add salt to taste later in the recipe.· Extra-virgin olive oil: The flavor of the olive oil comes through in this recipe, so use the best quality.· Shallots and garlic: These aromatics add flavor and fragrance to shrimp scampi.· White wine: Use a dry, crisp white wine for shrimp scampi sauce. Pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc are good choices, and you can drink the leftover wine with dinner.· Lemon juice: Use freshly squeezed lemon juice for the best flavor.· Seasonings: Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper amplify the flavors, and a pinch of dried red pepper flakes give shrimp scampi a subtle kick. Use more red pepper flakes if you like things a bit more spicy.· Parsley: Fresh parsley adds eye-catching color and a bright, peppery flavor. The full recipe directions are below, but here are top tips for recipe success: · Prep ahead: Have all of your ingredients prepared and ready to cook before heating your skillet.

1417,Spicy Thai Basil Chicken (Pad Krapow Gai),4.8,"(1,118)",774,15 mins,10 mins,25 mins,2,2 servings,"Allrecipes home cooks give a solid 5-star rating to Chef John's easy-to-make version of Thai basil chicken (pad krapow gai), a popular Thai restaurant-worthy dish that's ready in less than 30 minutes. In his easy and accessible style, Chef John walks you through the recipe ingredients and shows you how to build layers of flavor using simple cooking techniques. ""I don't cook Thai food at home often, mostly because there are at least a dozen such restaurants within walking distance, but when I do, there's nothing I enjoy more than this spicy Thai basil chicken,"" says Chef John. Thai basil chicken is a stir-fry dish made with finely chopped or ground chicken cooked with chile peppers, garlic, and shallots, and seasoned with a sweet and salty sauce and finished with fresh basil. It's a classic dish in Thai cuisine and can be found in restaurants and as a popular street food. SauceChicken broth, oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, white sugar, and brown sugar are whisked together to make a sweet and salty mixture to flavor the recipe. ChickenChef John minces skinless, boneless chicken thigh until they're very finely chopped. You could use packaged ground chicken to speed up the process, but chopping or grinding your own gives you superior flavor and texture. Shallots and garlicSliced shallots and minced garlic add another layer of flavor. Hot chile peppersThis is where the heat comes into play. Use Thai chile, serrano chile, or other hot pepper of your choice, and customize the amount to suit your tolerance for heat. BasilThis recipe traditionally uses Thai basil or ""holy"" basil, which have their own distinctive flavors. Chef John uses sweet basil, which is more readily available in most grocery stores. In the recipe video, Chef John demonstrates how he stacks and rolls basil leaves like a cigar to quickly slice thin ribbons that cook faster and impart flavor throughout the dish. ""No, I didn't use the real ""holy"" basil,"" says Chef John. ""But even with regular basil, this simple recipe is spectacular. Aromatic basil is the perfect herb for pairing with the slightly sweet, sort of salty, and possibly spicy, chopped meat."" There are more than 100 varieties of basil, all of which are members of the mint family, and each variety has its own flavor. Thai basil has a mildly spicy licorice or anise seed flavor. Sweet basil (also known as Italian basil) tastes sweet and peppery. Holy basil (also called Thai holy basil) tastes of pepper and cloves. Read more: What's the Difference Between Thai Basil, Sweet Basil, and Holy Basil? Chef John recommends you prep all the ingredients before you start cooking because once you start the stir-fry, it all comes together very quickly. Prep takes about 15 minutes and cooking time is a speedy 10 minutes. If you want to serve the chicken with steamed rice, time your cooking accordingly. To get started, you'll add the oil and minced chicken to a smoking-hot skillet and cook the chicken briefly for a couple of minutes. Next, you'll add the shallots, garlic, and sliced chilies, and cook for another couple of minutes. About a tablespoon of the sauce goes in next to cook for a minute with the chicken until it starts to caramelize on the skillet. Finally, you add the rest of the sauce, scraping up the caramelization and coating the chicken for another minute. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the basil until it's wilted from the residual heat. Now your Thai Basil Chicken is ready to serve. ""Amazing taste and for sure cheaper than buying it in a Thai restaurant,"" says Allrecipes home cook Seora Juarez. ""As suggested, go to a local Asian market to get your basil. It's a more authentic taste, but I've tried it with regular basil and it tastes good too. I like mine hot so I finely chop the peppers to make it spicy."" ""Amazing rendition of the classic Thai dish. I tend to use extra garlic and shallots. I use serrano chilies because traditional Thai chilies involve an extra grocery store. Otherwise make as directed. Perfect for family meals when I have the time to cook, and my kids love it,"" says reviewer Blair Dunn. Allrecipes community member outdoorsgirl says, ""I love Thai food and do a lot of cooking. Kudos to Chef John for taking a Thai recipe and simplifying it so the average person can make a great dish! Substituting sweet soya instead of the regular soya and sugar works good too. The trick is a very hot wok ( hopefully) or skillet.""

This simple ground beef stroganoff comes together in 20 minutes with just six ingredients. Beef stroganoff is an iconic Russian dish that consists of beef in a creamy sauce. According to legend, it was created by chefs who worked for the Stroganov family in the 1800s. The dish is often made with mushrooms and served over rice or egg noodles. Traditional beef stroganoff is made with steak, a roux-based sauce, and sauteed mushrooms. But, as the title suggests, this recipe is simplified. It relies on shortcut ingredients, such as ground beef and canned cream of mushroom soup, to keep the cook time down and to cut down on extra steps. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what can you can expect when you make this ground beef stroganoff: Saute ground beef until brown, then drain the fat. Add the canned soup and garlic powder. Simmer for about 10 minutes, then remove from heat. Stir cooked egg noodles and sour cream into the meat mixture. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Since this ground beef stroganoff is a rather heavy dish, you may not need a side dish at all. A simple side salad, though, is a great way to round out your meal and to add a pop of color. Of course, if you want something a little different, you could leave out the egg noodles and serve the ground beef and sauce mixture over white rice or mashed potatoes. Store leftover beef stroganoff in an airtight container in the fridge for up to four days. Reheat in the microwave or on the stove. Unfortunately, cooked egg noodles don't freeze well. If you'd like to freeze this ground beef stroganoff recipe, it's best to prepare it without the noodles. Freeze the beef-sauce mixture in a freezer-safe container for up to three months. Thaw on the stove and stir in cooked egg noodles before serving. ""My family loved this,"" says Amy Stewart.

There are plenty of delicious ways to marinate fish for grilling, but we're partial to this sweet and savory salmon marinade: Salmon filets are seasoned with lemon pepper, garlic powder, and salt, then marinated in a delicious combination of the following ingredients: soy sauce, brown sugar, water, and vegetable oil. Make sure to let the filets marinate in the fridge for at least two hours to reach their full flavor potential. Grilling the perfect salmon is probably easier than you think. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect: Season and marinate the salmon for at least two hours in the refrigerator. Preheat a grill and lightly oil the grate. Place the salmon on the grill and discard the marinade. Cook on each side until the fish flakes easily with a fork. The best temperature to grill salmon depends on a number of factors, including whether or not you're grilling the fish in foil. In this recipe, we grill the salmon directly on the grate without foil. For perfectly flaky salmon every time, we recommend grilling over medium heat. If you follow this recipe, your salmon should be perfectly grilled after about six to eight minutes on each side. Fish should be cooked to a minimum internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) before consuming, according to the USDA. Insert an instant read thermometer into the thickest part of the fish to make sure it's safe to eat.

Nicole McMom) calls this grilled salmon ""the perfect summer meal that comes together in a matter of minutes."" Here are a few of her best tips and tricks for making this simple, seasonal staple: · You might be tempted to stir the seasonings (lemon pepper, garlic powder, and salt) into the marinade instead of sprinkling it over the fish — but don't give into this temptation! Seasoning the salmon directly before adding it to the marinade is the key to a crispy crust.· Salmon has a tendency to stick to the grill grates. To prevent sticking: Use a grill brush to make sure the grates are completely clean, make sure the grill is ""screamin' hot"" (Nicole's words) so that the fish is able to naturally release, and use tongs and a paper towel to make sure the grates are thoroughly oiled before adding the salmon.· Brown sugar adds irresistible sweetness and helps with perfect caramelization, but it cooks extremely quickly. Make sure you shake off any excess marinade before grilling to prevent burning.· To achieve magazine-worthy grill marks, start grilling with the salmon's flesh side down. Flip it to finish cooking and use a fish spatula to easily remove it from the grate.· Finish the grilled salmon with a squeeze of lemon juice and a garnish of green onions for a burst of flavor and color.

Well, you can! You just need a good recipe — and that's where we come in. This top-rated recipe produces tender, juicy ribs that you'll want to make again and again. Baby back ribs (also called pork back ribs) come from high on the back of the hog, where the loin muscle meets the backbone. This lean cut of pork is extremely tender and flavorful. Baby back ribs can be smoked, grilled, or baked. They're usually seasoned and often served with a sweet and savory barbecue sauce. Spare ribs are cut from the bottom portion of the rib cage, while baby backs are cut from the top portion of the rib cage. Baby back ribs are leaner and cook faster than spare ribs, their heavier counterpart. Some people say spare ribs have richer flavor because they're more marbled, but baby backs are more popular because they have more meat and are more tender. Make perfect baby back ribs in the oven by following a few simple steps. You'll find Chef John's full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect: Mix ancho chile powder, white and brown sugars, salt, black pepper, cumin, dry mustard, cayenne, and chipotle pepper in a small bowl. Place the rack on an aluminum foil-lined baking sheet. Prick the rack several times with a knife. Season liberally on both sides with dry rub, then seal tightly in foil. Bake until tender and cooked through. Remove the rack from the oven, let cool slightly, and open the foil seal. Completely coat the rack in barbecue sauce, brushing it on all sides. Return it to the oven (with the foil open) and bake for about 10 more minutes. Remove from the oven again and brush again with barbecue sauce (on the meat side only). Repeat this process about four times, then cut and serve. This recipe generally takes about 2 hours and 50 minutes to cook. However, racks vary in size — bigger racks might take longer to cook, while smaller ones might be ready more quickly. Turn to your digital food thermometer for the most precise results: Ribs are technically safe to eat when they reach an internal temperature of 145 degrees F, but they will be most tender and juicy between 190 and 200 degrees F.
