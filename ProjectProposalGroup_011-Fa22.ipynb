    "We decided as a group to do an analysis related to food data; we felt that it's something that's very relevant and universally interesting. We've decided to utilize recipe data - something that's been done a lot before, for the same reason - since it has the potential to improve our abilities as cooks. This project will also allow us to use a good mix of data science and analysis techniques - web scraping, EDA, machine learning, and possibly sentiment analysis. \n",
